Limited to just 250 models worldwide, you'll have to move fast if you want to get your hands on one of these exclusive guitars.</p><h3> Classic Les Paul design </h3><p>Slash belting out legendary riffs on his Les Paul is one of the most iconic images in rock. The Gibson Custom Slash Les Paul takes on the customary tonewood single-customary body profile that we've all come to know and love. Lightweight mahogany establishes a firm and resounding midrange tonal foundation, infused with warm and a hearty sustain. Paired with this is a plain maple top, which is finished in a unique green Anaconda Burst paintwork that creates a striking visual aesthetic.</p><h3> Sturdy yet supple neck </h3><p>Connected to the body is a solid mahogany neck, which is fitted using a long tenon joint for improved sustain, and reinforced with a hide glue fit. The profile is shaped to Slash's custom taper, with a .910-inch depth at the 1st fret extending to a 1.05-inch depth at the 12th fret. The custom taper feels fast in the hand, and accommodates speedy solos to be executed with ease.</p><h3> Luxurious fingerboard </h3><p>Paired with the neck is a divine rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. The classic Les Paul single-cutaway opens up access to the highest frets, giving you free rein to let your fingers roam freely. Binding guarantees that seamless transition between frets are the norm, removing unwanted obstacles to maximise that lightning fast playing feel.</p><h3> Slash Signature Seymour Duncan pickups </h3><p>It is only fitting that the Gibson Custom Slash Les Paul be equipped with Slash's Signature Seymour Duncan APH-1 and APH-2 pickups. Since the recording of the seminal Guns N' Roses' album """"Appetite for Destruction"""", Slash has favoured the APH-1, with Seymour Duncan creating the APH-2 in its visage. The intensity of Slash's playing style is magnified when these pickups are cranked, but also retain a subtlety when rolled back during more intimate moments. Control over the pickups comes in the form of 500K CTS Volume and Tone pots, with hand-wired harness that feature Sprague Orange Drop capacitors, so that no matter how minor the attenuation, you have the smoothest of control with absolute precision. A Switchcraft toggle switch affords the same level of precision when changing between the bridge and neck pickups.</p><h3> Immaculate hardware </h3><p>The body is home to a nickel-finished lightweight aluminium ABR-1 bridge, which creates a seamless transition between strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain. Every inch of the Gibson Custom Slash Les Paul has been pored over to ensure it is completed to the highest possible standard. A brown/pink Custom Shop case is supplied with every model to guarantee that your pride and joy is well protected for many years to come.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,504-504-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/e616c271cde2d4c8ecd46b54519e5e7e.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson Custom Slash Les Paul Plain Top Electric Guitar - Anaconda Burst,Gibson Custom Slash Les Paul Plain Top Electric Guitar - Anaconda Burst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Throughout their long-standing working relationship, both Ibanez and Vai have benefited from their fruitful collaborations, creating some truly stunning models along the way. With their latest incarnation of the Jem, this is one to be treasured and appreciated. </p> <h3> Body </h3> <p> Adhering to the classic body design - complete with unique """"monkey grip"""" to aid in performing flashy stage manoeuvres -, the sleek and slender Super-Strat body profile has been crafted using lightweight American Basswood. Thanks to the wood's character, it produces a delightfully balanced tonality that enables the full sonic spectrum to be manipulated with the greatest of ease.

Ibanez know a thing or two about creating necks that are a joy to play, enabling you to tear along at lightning speeds. The neck has been reinforced with KTS Titanium rods so you can rest assured that string action is consistent no matter what. Paired with the neck is a maple fingerboard, which is home to 24-frets that are a guitarist's dream. Adorning the fingerboard is a divine """"Tree of Life"""" inlay, which traces the gorgeous body finish all the way up to the headstock. </p> <h3> Hardware </h3> <p> Fitted to the body is a responsive and easy to control Edge-Zero II locking tremolo bridge, so you can dive and wail to your heart's content, safe in the knowledge that the bridge will return to original position smoothly and swiftly. The chrome black hardware is understated, and complements the finish beautifully. </p> <h3> Electronics </h3> <p> The Jem77P is equipped with trio of DiMarzio pickups: Gravity Storm humbucking pickups in the neck and bridge positions, an Evolution single-coil pickup in the middle position. Between the three pickups you have a universe of tonal exploration ahead of you. Control couldn't be simpler, with a master volume and a master tone pot to shape and sculpt your output, as well as a 5-way pickup selector switch. </p> <p> The Jem has been turning heads since its introduction over 25 years ago, and with the Ibanez Jem77P Steve Vai Signature Guitar with Blue Floral Pattern they've done it again. Visually stunning, sonically brilliant, tonally diverse, and a joy to play. What more could any guitarist desire?

Now the guys at Gibson Custom have brought it back with historically accurate appointments to give you a reincarnation that is as close to the original as possible. This was one of the first Gibson sunburst models which has since become legendary and this new version brings it right up to date.</p><h3>MAPLE AND MAHOGANY</h3><p>In 1958 when Gibson first designed the original Les Paul Standard guitars, they would all feature a two-piece maple body top, and the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard indeed has a two-piece figured maple top. Figured maple is instantly eye-catching due to its flame-like texture while it also contributes to producing that vintage, '58 sound of the original.</p><p>The top is accompanied by mahogany in the back and sides which makes for the perfect partnership with the figured maple top to produce a strong, resonant output as authentic as those models which were first released in the late 50s. This version is given the 1950s style Les Paul body contour with no weight relief for a historically correct feel.</p><h3>VINTAGE CORRECT NECK</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard is fitted with a single-piece mahogany neck with a comfortable 1950's style Les Paul profile. It is firmly joined to the body using hot hide-glue which was a constitutional element of the original guitars. The neck also has a historic long-tenon neck joint which enables the guitar to precisely convey its classic tone.</p><p>Aboard the neck is a solid, one-piece Indian rosewood fingerboard which assists the mahogany in providing an all-round Les Paul sound. With 22 frets at your service, you can work your way up and down the neck in confidence thanks to the cellulose Trapezoid inlays.</p><h3>CUSTOM BUCKER PICKUPS</h3><p>Gibson have employed Custom Bucker pickups in the electronics of the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard, and consider them to be their best replica of PAF pickups yet. The Custom Buckers achieve an output that is as close to the original sound of a '58 guitar as you can imagine. Each pickup is powered by Alnico III magnets which deliver you a mix of epic ringing or deep rumble depending on the sound output that you require.</p><p>To help you control the rhythm and lead pickups, the guitar is fitted with two Volume and two Tone pots with matched 500k potentiometers and encased with gold top hats.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard has an ABR bridge with thumbwheels partnered with a lightweight aluminium stop bar tailpiece which enhances the overall intonation and sustain. At the top end of the guitar at the headstock we have reissue Kluson deluxe green keys made with nickel plated steel to uphold tuning integrity with accuracy.</p><p>Protecting the beautiful, hand-sprayed nitrocellulose finish on the body is a 1950's style cream pickguard which also really complements the guitar. The guitar also comes equipped with a reissue Les Paul case with a brown outer and pink fur lining to further protect this wonderful guitar.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,544-544-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/0553481300f49443f3f68d82ccc50f15.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul - Ice Tea,Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul - Ice Tea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

It first arrived in 1960, and since then, this limited edition model has had many upgrades. Gibson have employed Adirondack red spruce in the guitar's construction, an eminent tonewood that looks and sounds just stunning.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>The Hummingbird is well-renowned as being Gibson's first square-shoulder dreadnought acoustic, and this recent limited edition retains that historic shape. This flat top acoustic has an AA-grade Adirondack red spruce body top which is radiused with scalloped bracing; this improves the guitar's ability to resonate, while augmenting its vintage acoustic voice.</p><p>The back and sides of this Hummingbird Red Spruce guitar are constructed from mahogany, a popular tonewood known for its sonic warmth. The warm Vintage Cherry Sunburst finish is meticulously done by hand using a finer grit sandpaper, giving the Hummingbird its VOS true vintage visual aesthetic.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>A mahogany neck is firmly fitted to the body via the compound dovetail joint for improved resonance. The neck is shaped to a round profile, offering a smooth playing feel. Aboard the neck is a rosewood fingerboard, presenting you with 20 frets and decorated beautifully with Mother-of-Pearl parallelogram inlays.</p><p>The neck and fingerboard feel more comfortable than ever thanks to the softened fingerboard edge which is designed to fit perfectly in the hand. Gibson have gone the extra mile to make this limited edition Hummingbird feel like the best acoustic playing surface, and this is a result of the German-engineered, hand-finished Plek technology used in the construction of all Gibson acoustics.</p><h3>Electronics</h3><p>Gibson have employed the incredibly flexible LR Baggs VTC pickup system to amplify the Hummingbird Red Spruce. The LR Baggs VTC pickup has a subtle construction and sits just under the saddle. This pickup system is unparalleled in the world of acoustic amplification, working relentlessly alongside the guitar itself to provide the truest acoustic voice. The controls for Volume and Tone sit just beneath the soundhole and are easy to adjust, making sound control incredibly simple.</p><h3>Hardware and Finish</h3><p>The lower bout of the Hummingbird is fitted with a traditional belly up rosewood bridge, and like the fingerboard, the bridge is treated with a new finishing oil which gets right into the wood to ensure that it will last even longer.</p><p>The headstock of the Hummingbird is equipped with gold Gotoh Keystone tuning keys, accurately maintaining the tuning of each string in conjunction with the Tusq saddle.</p><p>The Hummingbird Red Spruce is a limited edition model whereby there are only approximately 50 of these worldwide that have been hand-made! This exquisite Vintage Cherry Sunburst acoustic has a real vintage feel and appearance, and its traditional casted Hummingbird pickguard adds to it. Gibson also supply a protective black hardshell case with each purchase as well as a Gibson Acoustic Owner's Manual.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,517-517-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/e221c526293ccafcd0fbebed50f895d3.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson Hummingbird Red Spruce Acoustic - Vintage Cherry Sunburst VOS,Gibson Hummingbird Red Spruce Acoustic - Vintage Cherry Sunburst VOS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The thinline body shape with single-cutaway body profile harks back to a golden age of guitar design. However, this pure hollowbody isn't just for jazz purists. Thanks to some modern appointments and ingenious work from the Gibson Memphis team, the ES-275 Custom is perfect for rock, blues, and just about anything your heart desires.</p><h3>Classic design</h3><p>The ES-275 Custom is built with a completely hollow body and an arched top, which enables it to generate a powerful timbre. By employing 3-ply figured maple/poplar/maple in the construction of the body, the ES-275 resonates freely thanks to quartersawn Adirondack spruce bracing, whilst receiving support to prevent against unwanted warping over time. The stylish sunset burst finish is paired with premium appointments that include a sumptuous multi-bound tortoise pickguard, which obscures one of the two lovingly carved f-holes. The paintwork is treated to a coating of gloss nitrocellulose lacquer, which prevents any premature wear and tear from blemishing the beautiful finish.</p><h3>Sturdy mahogany neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a sturdy quartersawn mahogany neck, which is shaped to the ever so comfortable rounded """"C"""" profile. Paired with the neck is a glorious dark rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with mother of pearl full block inlays to guide your way in style. The neck features rolled binding to make transitions along its entire length as smooth as possible. Thanks to the thinline body shape and single-cutaway profile, the upper frets are within comfortable reach to give you total freedom to explore the fingerboard in its entirety.</p><h3>Memphis Historic Spec pickups</h3><p>To bring the best out of the 2018 ES-275 Custom Archtop, Gibson have designed a pair of Memphis Historic Spec humbuckers to dutifully translate the rich timbre of the guitar. The hand-wired control assembly with Orange Drop capacitors and matched 550K pots afford precision attenuation of volume and tone levels.

Constructed from high quality woods and materials to improve comfort and the overall playing feel, the Modern Les Paul Axcess Custom has been redesigned to appeal to the masses. Plus, the Ebony finish of this model is complemented beautifully by gold hardware.</p><h3>Classic Combination</h3><p>As with many Les Paul guitars before now, the Modern Les Paul Axcess Custom features the conventional partnership of maple and mahogany. Two pieces of maple are used for the body top for a crisp, clear tone. Paired with the maple top is a solid mahogany body which features weight relief for a more lightweight feel, reducing fatigue when you play. There is also a comfort-carve belly scarf for improved playability and performance, while the redesigned back contours feel more comfortable than ever. Multi-ply white binding completes the Ebony body.</p><h3>SOLID NECK</h3><p>The Modern Les Paul Axcess Custom is firmly fitted with a 24.75 inch scale length solid mahogany neck.

The neck is shaped to the Slim """"C"""" profile for an optimal playing feel that is ideal for faster playing styles. The neck is topped with 22 medium-jumbo frets on a richlite fingerboard which offers a sumptuous playing surface beneath your fingertips. Block pearl inlays decorate the frets guiding each note or chord transition. The neck features rolled binding over the frets for an enhanced feel in the hand.</p><h3>496R and 498T Humbuckers</h3><p>Blistering, vivid humbucker tones can be achieved by means of the 496R and 498T pickups. These pickups are known for their incredibly hot tone from the neck and bridge positions offering a powerful responsive voice. Each of the pickups are powered by Alnico magnets which adds to their beefy output. Whether you're playing potent leads or thick rhythm, the Modern Les Paul Axcess Custom will duly respond.</p><p>At the lower bout of the body there are two 500K Push-Pull Pots for Tone Control and Coil Splitting, and two 500K Pots for Volume Control accompanied by a Switchcraft toggle switch.</p><h3>Hardware and Finish</h3><p>A new addition to the Modern Les Paul Axcess Custom is the Apex headstock.

Unlike the Les Paul, the SG has a double cutaway, innovative for its time, and it was met with instant fame. The 2017 SG Standard Traditional model remains the leader of the modern SG range, combining quintessential SG sound and appearance with up-to-date appointments and playing feel.</p><h3>BODY</h3><p>The most recognisable feature of the Gibson SG is its double-horned cutaway body, a feature which made it stand out among previous Gibson guitars at the time of its creation. In line with history, the 2017 SG Standard T body is constructed from mahogany, a popular choice of tonewood for the Gibson luthiers thanks to its superb sound delivery.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>A single-piece mahogany neck is securely joined to the body via a traditional Mortis and Tenon joint using the most reliable Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive. The neck is shaped to the Slim Taper profile, offering faster, more comfortable playability.</p><p>The neck is topped with a 12 inch radius rosewood fingerboard with 22 frets, all are readily available thanks to the body's double cutaway. The rosewood is thicker than usual, contributing to the overall sonic depth of the SG. The frets are also decorated with traditional white trapezoid inlays to guide you. Gibson have included a Tektoid nut that is self-lubricating for a better return to pitch and improved sustain.</p><h3>CLASSIC HUMBUCKERS</h3><p>The 2017 SG Standard T is kitted out with a pair of '57 Classic humbucker pickups powered by the outstanding Alnico II magnets. As soon as you plug in and play, the two humbuckers work relentlessly together to give you that classic PAF-style Gibson tone.</p><p>As with many Gibson models, the 2017 SG Standard T features the four-knob control setup for rhythm and lead Volume and Tone. The knobs have classic black tophats and are accompanied by a 3-way pickup toggle switch.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The headstock has a traditional appearance, with a black and white bell truss rod cover with """"SG"""" stamped on, alongside the usual Gibson logo decal and crown. For total tuning accuracy, the SG is equipped with locking Grover Kidney-button tuners with a precise 14:01 gear ratio.</p><p>The body is fitted with a traditional chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge and an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece for exceptional sustain and resonance.</p><p>The 2017 SG Standard T model features a smaller teardrop-style black pickguard, similar to that found on the models released throughout the early 1960s' SGs. To enable the owner to keep the SG well looked after, Gibson include a hardshell brown case with the purchase, as well as a strap and polishing cloth to get you performance-ready right away.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,497-497-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/49813010dc79832157905cd7654c0ca9.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson 2017 SG Standard T Electric Guitar - Heritage Cherry,Gibson 2017 SG Standard T Electric Guitar - Heritage Cherry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

One of the first solidbody guitars became an overnight success much to Gibson's surprise, and this was the now renowned Firebird. This astonishing guitar was the brainchild of car designer Ray Dietrich who worked alongside Ted McCarty (the then Gibson President). With its unique shape derived from car tailfins, this new Gibson was a revolution, and the 2017 Traditional rendition keeps many of the original historic features with some added new and exclusive appointments.</p><h3>BODY</h3><p>Unlike guitars at the time of its birth in the early 1960s, the Firebird had a reverse-style body and a longer right horn, which it retains today. The neck-through-body is constructed from mahogany, a preferred tonewood for Gibson. The mahogany body feels lightweight and comfortable, reducing fatigue especially for performers and live musicians.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>As mentioned, the 2017 Firebird T has a neck-through-body construction, which boosts sustain and grants full access to all the frets, even the upper registers. The neck is made up of mahogany and walnut and shaped to the classic Firebird Slim Taper profile for a faster, more comfortable playing feel in the hand of a modern guitarist.</p><p>The neck is topped with a thicker rosewood fingerboard providing you with 22 frets to enjoy. The use of this thicker rosewood boosts tonal depth produced by the guitar for a high quality sound output. Gibson have fitted a Tektoid nut that is self-lubricating for a better return to pitch and improved sustain.</p><h3>ELECTRONICS</h3><p>The 2017 Firebird T is equipped with a pair of Mini Humbucker pickups, with one in the neck position and another in the bridge position. The original Firebirds were also fitted with this superb pickup duo, and the 2017 version will still deliver those PAF-style authentic Gibson tones.</p><p>Featuring the usual controls for rhythm and lead Volume and Tone and a 3-way toggle pickup switch, you can shape your tone to suit your playing needs. Each control has a black tophat with a silver insert, complementing the body finish.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The Firebird T headstock is directly fitted with the exceptional Steinberger Gearless tuning keys set to a 40:01:00 gear ratio. Their rare design and precise ratio ensure consistency in tuning each string as well as improving the overall sustain.</p><p>To further boost sustain and resonance there is a traditional chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge and an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece.</p><p>To protect and complement the body's smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer finish is a 3-ply white Firebird pickguard with the quintessential gold Firebird on it. To enable the guitarist to look after this wonderful guitar as best as possible, Gibson include a brown Firebird hardshell case, premium strap and polishing cloth.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,438-438-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/fb9aa505ad613e1b714e74170a2b4f40.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson 2017 Firebird T Electric Guitar - Vintage Sunburst,Gibson 2017 Firebird T Electric Guitar - Vintage Sunburst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Taylor's most popular body shape, Grand Auditorium, has been chosen for the body of the Taylor K24ce Electro Acoustic Guitar, because of its versatility of tone, especially in the midrange, and note definition, which make it equally capable for both flatpicking and strumming styles. Also making up the Taylor K24ce's silhouette is a Venetian cutaway. This addition gives unrestricted access to the upper frets and adds to the beauty of the instrument, with its soft, round curves.</p><p>Also of note in the construction of the Taylor K24ce Electro Acoustic Guitar is the bracing used for its top: CV with Relief Rout. Along with other refinements, this bracing loosens the edges of the top, whilst retaining structural integrity, to increase flexibility and give a fuller, fatter sound without affecting articulation.</p><p>The body of the Taylor K24ce Electro Acoustic Guitar is unmistakably Hawaiian Koa in its construction. This beautiful wood is more than just a pretty face, however. Tonally it sits nicely between mahogany and maple, with mahogany's midrange and maple's top end. It is one of those woods that likes to played and rewards its owner over time; starting out bright and focussed, but developing a wider midrange and a richer, sweeter, more resonant tone.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>Joined to the body of the Taylor K24ce Electro Acoustic Guitar is a mahogany neck, topped by an ebony fingerboard with the gorgeous Island Vine inlay spanning its length, which also appears on the headstock. Like the body, this has an Indian rosewood binding that splits up the design nicely.</p><h3>Electronics</h3><p>Although an excellent acoustic guitar, the Taylor K24ce Electro Acoustic Guitar also gives you the option of plugging into an amplifier or PA system. Ensuring that none of the guitar's character is lost when travelling from guitar to speaker, Taylor have developed their own pickup system, now in its second version, the Taylor Expression System 2.</p><p>Through their research Taylor found that the best place for a pickup is behind, rather than under the saddle, and this is where you will find the pickup on the Taylor K24ce Electro Acoustic Guitar. Made up of three strategically placed sensors installed through the bridge, the Taylor Expression System 2 gets the best from the guitar. It also gives you a set of three discreet controls knobs at the upper bout, for quick and easy tone shaping. These controls are: volume, treble, and bass.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Taylor Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,1120-1120-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/02deed32bd9c2d5fd9b82c9c47c09cb3.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Taylor K24ce Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,Taylor K24ce Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

From the meticulously crafted tonewoods to the heavenly Aquamarine finish, this model exudes high quality down to the tiniest detail.It is fair to say that the Gibson Memphis team have outdone themselves with this one.</p><h3>Classic ES-335 design</h3><p>The body is carved to the instantly recognisable ES Series shape, with elegant curves and sweeping edges that make it such a joy to behold. The 3-ply figured maple/poplar/maple tonewood construction lends itself beautifully to the semi-hollowbody shape, by generating a wide dynamic range that is infused with warmth and a balanced frequency range. Present and correct is the maple centre block that prevents the energetic character of the ES-335 from running away with itself, so that what remains is an output that sounds as sweet at low or high volume levels. The lightweight feel is matched by the solid construction of the body, which guarantees resilience throughout each and every performance.</p><p>However, it is the finish that sets the 2018 ES-335 Figured model apart. The Aquamarine paintwork complements the figured maple top in immaculate fashion, whilst single-ply cream binding adds to the visual aesthetic fittingly.</p><h3>Strong and supportive neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a quartersawn mahogany neck, which establishes a sturdy feel in the hand for total reassurance as you play. The neck is shaped to the rounded """"C"""" profile for a substantial yet manageable feel in the hand. The rolled binding enables seamless transitions along the neck for a speedy playing experience. The neck is paired with a luxurious rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with pearloid small block position inlays to guide your way in style.</p><h3>Memphis Historic Spec pickups</h3><p>The 2018 ES-335 Figured is equipped with a pair of Memphis Historic Spec humbuckers, which are designed with meticulous attention to detail in order to translate the ES-335's balanced timbre with the utmost fidelity. From rich and resounding mid to low-end energy through a punchy midrange to a searing high-end output, these pickups deliver a highly versatile tonal palette.</p><p>As noted above, the Gibson Memphis team have spared nothing in securing a high-end product. The hand-wired MTC Premiere control assembly with Orange Drop capacitors and 550K matched pots offer peerless volume and tone adjustment, giving you total mastery over your pickup and tone control.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The body is equipped with an ABR-1 bridge with titanium saddles to increase clarity, definition and sustain. The aluminium tailpiece with locking studs reinforces the bridge's consistency, whilst the Grover """"Milk Bottle"""" Rotomatic tuners uphold tuning integrity dutifully throughout the most energetic of performances.</p><p>Each Gibson Memphis 2018 ES-335 Figured Electric Guitar is supplied with a hardcase to protect your model at home and on the go, as well as an accessory kit to help keep it in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,540-540-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/63019eba5ea328446526ea6953c42b8e.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson Memphis 2018 ES-335 Figured Electric Guitar - Aquamarine,Gibson Memphis 2018 ES-335 Figured Electric Guitar - Aquamarine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

With the sheer attitude of the humbucker pickups combined with its special design, it's no wonder that famous guitarists such as Alex Lifeson and Tommy Shaw have made it their primary choice. This is purely down to its incredible feel, or as Gibson say, """"contoured for comfort"""", making it the ultimate choice for any electric guitar player.</p><h3>MAPLE AND MAHOGANY</h3><p>An often prevalent feature in the design of a Les Paul is the need for a maple / mahogany partnership. The CS Les Paul Axcess has a top constructed from two pieces of maple which is then paired with a solid mahogany body. For the Axcess model, it has a thinner body depth which consequently ensures the guitar has a lighter feel, perfect for the performing musician who has to stand on stage for hours on end. Furthermore, the back of the body has a belly carve which ensures the guitar stays close to your body while you play, providing you with a flawless feel.</p><h3>MAHOGANY NECK</h3><p>A durable, one-piece mahogany neck is firmly fitted to the body and is shaped to the Les Paul Axcess profile. One of the best features of the guitar has to be its Axcess heel carve, which is what allows you to explore each and every fret without obstruction. There are 22 frets at your service on a sumptuous richlite fingerboard, paired with multi-ply binding which contributes to effortless fret transitions.</p><h3>496R AND 498T PICKUPS</h3><p>The CS Les Paul Axcess is equipped with 496R and 498T pickups which deliver an illuminous range of searing humbucker tones. Each pickup is powered by a ceramic magnet with #42 enamel wiring for a truly powerful sound delivery. For biting, crunchy rock or clean tones full of sustain, the pairing of a 496R and 498T pickup is sublime.</p><p>Four control knobs sit to the lower bout of the guitar for lead and rhythm Volume and Tone, and a three-way pickup switch allows you to adjust your sound to suit your playing needs.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>Gibson Custom have opted for a traditional hardware choice in the appointment of a Tune-o-Matic bridge with a stopbar tailpiece, both of which are gold, standing out against the beautiful gloss finish of the guitar. This conventional partnership improves the sustain and intonation of this superb Les Paul.</p><p>The quintessential Gibson Custom headstock is fitted with gold LP Custom tuning keys which work tirelessly to uphold tuning integrity.</p><p>The CS Les Paul Axcess includes a black LP Custom hard case for added protection when out on the road, as well as a Gibson Custom Shop Certificate of Authenticity.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,524-524-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/60910e7bf01616678c8182fced03fed6.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson CS Les Paul Axcess Stopbar Electric Guitar - Ebony,Gibson CS Les Paul Axcess Stopbar Electric Guitar - Ebony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Through a combination of vintage-style and updated technology, Gibson has captured the vibrant energy and character of a classic Les Paul, whilst exceeding the tonal demands of today's guitarists.</p><h3>Sleek Les Paul design</h3><p>As you'd expect, the body is crafted using classic combination of two-piece mahogany that has been combined with a grade A plain maple top. The mahogany has been treated to a 9-hole weight relief rout, which makes the body lighter and easier to wield, without losing any of that raw Les Paul power. The maple doesn't just look pretty either; it lends itself to a sweetly delivered high-end that allows this beauty to truly sparkle. The body protected by a smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer, which preserves that natural grain and paintwork to allow your Les Paul to age gracefully.</p><h3>Single-piece mahogany neck</h3><p>To create a confident playing feel, Gibson have fitted a single-piece mahogany neck using a solid mortise and tenon joint reinforced using Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive. You can rest assured that no matter how hard you play, the neck is built with durability at its heart. Thanks to its slimtaper profile, the neck is delightfully slender and accommodating most player's hands with ease.</p><p>Married to the neck is a heavenly rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. Cream binding along the fingerboard ensures seamless transitions between frets, whilst the standard 12-inch radius makes it a breeze to perform smooth string bends.</p><h3>Zebra '57 Classic humbuckers</h3><p>To create a tonal match for the sophisticated '60s/'70s aesthetic, the Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar is equipped with a Zebra '57 Classic in the neck position, and a Zebra '57 Classic Plus in the bridge. The depth and warmth of the mahogany is given the commanding presence it deserves, with a hearty mid to low-end energy flowing from the pickups, thanks to the wound Alnico II magnet-driven humbuckers. The crispness of the maple rings truly, offering a snappy counterpoint to the dense mahogany.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes via the pickup independent volume and tone controls, which allow you to sculpt and shape your tone with precision. Orange Drop capacitors ensure that the slightest of adjustments is executed as smoothly as possible, putting absolute tone control in your hands.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>The headstock is home to Grover's zamak locking tuners with an impressive 14:01 tuning ratio, so you can rest assured that no slipping will occur during any emphatic string bending. The strings meet the body via the nickel-plated zamak ABR bridge and nickel-plated aluminium stop bar tailpiece. From the tuning machines down to the tailpiece, everything is designed and fitted to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>Each Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar model is supplied with a classic Gibson hardshell case in brown to protect your pride and joy whether it is in storage or in transit. With the 2017 model you will also receive a Gibson USA multi tool, premium strap, polishing cloth, and owner's manual to help you to keep your Les Paul in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,464-464-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/1ef23b25726f3bd285bfea0bdca27ab9.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Guitar - Green Ocean Burst,Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Guitar - Green Ocean Burst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Married to the body - using Franklin Titebond adhesive - is a heavenly two-piece book-matched flame maple top, which is bound in 50s' cream single-binding. The maple counters the dense mahogany by gently underpinning the low to mid-end clout, whilst introducing a softer upper-range with crispness and clarity.</p><p>The Custom Shop team has adopted the 1950s' style body contour to create a smooth and comfortable playing feel. Each model's finish it protected by a slender but resilient layer of nitrocellulose lacquer, which allows the wood to resonate unimpeded whilst shielding the beautiful grain from unwanted damage.</p><h3> Sturdy mahogany neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a single piece mahogany, which has been set using the historic long neck tenon and reinforced using hot hide glue for added strength. The long neck tenon joint is renowned for its superior sound transference, adding to the already impressive tones produced by this monster.

With its distinct shape and style, Gibson have revamped the Flying V with a version for 2017, taking primary features from the original 1958 model as its foundation. Kitted out with Dirty Fingers pickups to deliver a classic, heavy rock tone, the 2017 Flying V sounds as good as ever.</p><h3>V-SHAPE BODY</h3><p>The 2017 version of the legendary Flying V has a body constructed entirely from mahogany, hand-chosen by the expert luthiers at Gibson USA to improve the guitar's ability to resonate freely. The body has a lightweight feel designed to appeal to the masses.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>Firmly fitted to the Flying V body is a smooth mahogany neck, the tonewood of choice for Gibson. The neck is fitted using the traditional Mortis and Tenon joint using the extra tough Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive. The neck of a Flying V is known for its ultra fast Slim Taper profile, and the 2017 model retains this advantageous feature. Due to the radical shape of the Flying V it allows for full access to the upper frets of the neck.</p><p>Aboard the neck is a thicker, 12 inch radius grenadillo fingerboard with 22 frets on offer. Gibson have selected a thicker tonewood for the fingerboard due to its rich sonic contribution to the modern Flying V. The light shade of the fingerboard is complemented by white dot inlays to guide you. The neck also features a Tektoid nut which lubricates itself, consequently improving sustain and ensuring accuracy when returning to pitch.</p><h3>DIRTY FINGERS</h3><p>Gibson have chosen an incredibly powerful, robust pair of ceramic humbucker pickups to give the Flying V some real clout. Dirty Fingers humbucker pickups are fitted in the neck and bridge positions. Gibson may well have their most powerful set of pickups fitted to this Flying V, ideal for hard, heavy rock but versatile enough in many other musical genres.</p><p>Gibson have included two Volume controls plus a Master Tone knob joined by a 3-way toggle pickup switch.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>For reliable, precise tuning, Gibson have employed Grover kidney-button tuners on the headstock. The tuners are constructed from a lightweight Zamak material and have a 14:01 gear ratio.</p><p>A traditional chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge and an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece is fitted to the body ensuring enhanced sustain and resonance.</p><p>Stand-out visual appointments include the protective 3-ply white pickguard, the silver Gibson logo on the arrowhead and black top hat control knobs with silver inserts. To keep the guitar in the best possible condition, Gibson include a Flying V hard shell brown case, a set of handy tools plus a Gibson USA Owner's Manual.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,443-443-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/2832a5d72607106c4cd53d83ff7af412.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson 2017 Flying V Traditional Electric Guitar,Gibson 2017 Flying V Traditional Electric Guitar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Delivering the lush tonal complexity of a hollowbody with the classic chime and jangle that comes with the increased string count, Gretsch has created a breath-taking model that is equally at home in the studio and on the stage. Packed with a pair of Blacktop Filter'Tron pickups, you can play the mesmerising timbre of the G5422TG-12 via an amplifier without making any compromise with regard to timbre.</p><h3> Bound thinline double-cutaway body </h3><p>The body has been shaped to that of a thinline hollowbody profile, which marries comfortability and tonal versatility beautifully. The 5-ply maple tonewood works harmoniously with the body profile to generate a confident midrange energy that has a softly rounded low end and sparkling brilliance across the upper frequencies.</p><p></p>As well as ensuring the timbre of the G5422TG-12 is second to none, the team at Gretsch have gone to great lengths to resurrect the vintage aesthetic of their historic models, whilst appointing modern touches to maintain a solid and stable playing feel. The body top incorporates stylish over-sized bound f-holes, which allow the timbre to ease through for a smooth yet subtle acoustic projection. The top is bound to offer protection to the edges and complement the finish. Protection is offered to the paintwork in the form of a slender yet resilient gloss finish. A gold plexi pickguard, complete with black Gretsch logo, resides just beneath the pickups to prevent unwanted nicks and scrapes from affecting the lower bout.<p></p><h3> Gloss-finished maple neck </h3><p>Joined to the body is a fast-playing, gloss-finished maple neck, which is shaped to a """"U""""-shape profile to create a comfortable feel in the hand. Paired with the neck is a 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which has been bound to guarantee seamless transitions between frets that are adorned with pearloid hump-block position inlays. The 12-inch fingerboard radius makes executing string bends are breeze, whilst the double-cutaway body profile means that each and every fret is within easy reach.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck you'll find a Graph Tech nubone nut, which works in partnership with the vintage-style open-back tuning machines to stabilise string tension and tuning integrity. Connected to the body is a smaller late-'50s G6120 bound headstock, which proudly shows off a white Gretsch logo. Fitted to the G5422TG-12 is an adjusto-matic bridge with a secured rosewood-base, which is paired with a Gretshc G-Cutout tailpiece. The hardware creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3> Blacktop Filter'Tron pickups </h3><p>Fitted to the body are two BlackTop Filter'Tron humbuckers in the neck and bridge positions. Designed to enhance the """"fat"""" timbre produced by the body, this pair produce an enviable tonal arsenal for you to play with. The neck position enhances the plucky articulation of the neck and fingerboard, whilst the bridge pickup draws more from the body, generating a thunderous charge when you want it.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of a three-way pickup selector toggle switch, which allows you to select either pickup independently or select both outputs simultaneously for a fuller tone. Each pickup has an independent volume knob, and both are connected to master volume and tone pots.</p><p>The Gretsch G5422TG-12 Electromatic hollowbody guitar is the perfect model for those who want the sparkling majesty of a 12-string in a model that is very comfortable to perform with, and offers a highly versatile tonal palette to paint with. Whether you're picking up your first model, or are a seasoned pro who is seeking a reliable touring partner, it doesn't get much better than this.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gretsch Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,641-641-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/c1caf8bb19dfab38a09ffc2ae89565c4.jpeg,1,,FALSE,G5422TG-12 12-String Electromatic Hollowbody Guitar,G5422TG-12 12-String Electromatic Hollowbody Guitar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

However, this stripped back affair is just as much guts as it is glory, and perfect for those who want an affordable model to hit the stage with, whilst still retaining that classic Gibson look and feel.</p><h3>Classic design without frills</h3><p>At the heart of this model is the same classic tonewood setup that has been the driving force of the Les Paul's tone for decades - a solid mahogany body with a crisp maple top to supply an exquisite balance of power and precision. To increase playing comfort, the body has been treated to modern weight relief, which takes the back-breaking labour out of every performance, without compromising on that sumptuous Les Paul tone. As previously stated, the faded look may offer a less polished finish than that of pricier models, but it is in no way less eye catching. With a healthy lacquer to finish the job, you can rest assured that it will outshine all its rivals for years to come.</p><h3> Sturdy and responsive neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid maple neck, which has been treated to a slim taper profile to lend its support in creating the most comfortable playing experience. Married to the body is a sublime rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with dot position inlays to aid in your navigation. The single-cutaway body profile allows you to reach the upper frets with ease.</p><p>At the top of the neck you'll find the headstock, which is equipped with vintage-style keystone tuners to uphold tuning integrity with precision. The partnership of tuners and Tektoid nut stabilises string tension to maintain the playing feel across each string throughout even the most energetic of performances. Fitted to the body is an aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with steel thumbwheels, as well as an aluminium stop bar tailpiece with steel posts. The bridge and tailpiece work together harmoniously to optimise intonation and sustain by creating a seamless connection between strings and body.</p><h3>Upgraded electronics</h3><p>The Gibson Les Paul Faded T Electric Guitar is fitted with an impressive pickup pairing that includes a 490R in the neck position, and a 490T in the bridge position. Control over the pickups comes via independent volume and tone pots for each pickup, as well as a three-way selector switch. The range of tonal colours you have to paint with is astonishing, with murky muddy, fat saturated lows to impeccably polished highs that sing. Whatever style of music you are tackling, the Les Paul Faded T is more than capable of exceeding your expectations.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>To complete the package, the Gibson Les Paul Faded T Electric Guitar is supplied with a padded gig bag to protect your new pride and joy, as well as get you out on the road asap. Each model also comes with a strap and polishing cloth, to help keep your new guitar in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,537-537-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/617d6cd4cee79d21ab21a7190118759f.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson Les Paul Faded T Electric Guitar - Worn Brown,Gibson Les Paul Faded T Electric Guitar - Worn Brown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

For nearly two hundred years, Martin have honed their instrument-building skills, and as you'd expect from a company who pioneered the dreadnought guitar, X-bracing and the 14-fret model, it is only fair to say that the modern acoustic guitar would not exist in the form that it does without their developments.</p><p>The back and sides of the guitar are built from solid East Indian rosewood, which produces a warmth that is infused with a stability that enables it to produce deep, rich tones. Not only that but it looks absolutely gorgeous too. The HD-28 has a driving mid to low-end energy that produces a forceful punch. The top has been crafted using solid Sikta spruce, a brilliant North American tonewood that has the enviable combination of being lightweight whilst retaining exceptional resilience, strength and elasticity. Due to its superb resonant qualities, spruce enables the soundboard to project a big sound with ease. Thanks to the standard """"X"""" scalloped bracing pattern, the top is reinforced to prevent the chance of warping over time, but is able to resonate freely.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>The neck is cut to the low profile neck shape to guarantee a reassuring feel in the hand without feeling cumbersome or bulky.

Martin's """"style 28"""" position inlays provide a stylish navigational aid.</p><h3> Hardware </h3><p>The body top beneath the soundhole and along the lower bout is protected from pickscrapes that can occur during performances by a tortoise colour pickguard. The chrome enclosed tuning machines with large buttons uphold tuning integrity with the utmost precision. The bone nut maintains string tension keenly, whilst the solid black ebony bridge provides a seamless connection between the strings and body for optimum intonation.</p><h3>Finish</h3><p>The body is bound by a white boltaron, which encases the stunning natural finish in style. Protection has been given to the woods in the form of polished gloss to the top, back and sides. Martin has developed their own unique recipe to guarantee the woods are protected from unwanted damage, temperature/humidity changes, without impeding the woods ability to resonate to their fullest.</p><p>The Martin HD-28 dreadnought acoustic guitar is quite simply one of the finest acoustic guitar models available, built by a company who have been crating impeccable acoustic guitars since 1833.

Through a combination of vintage-style and updated technology, Gibson has captured the vibrant energy and character of a classic Les Paul, whilst exceeding the tonal demands of guitarists all over the world.</p><h3>Unmistakable design</h3><p>As you'd expect, the body is crafted using classic combination of two-piece mahogany that has been combined with a grade A plain maple top. The maple doesn't just look pretty either; it lends itself to a sweetly delivered high-end that allows this beauty to truly sparkle. The body protected by a smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer, which preserves that natural grain and paintwork to allow your Les Paul to age gracefully. The 2018 Les Paul Classic also bypasses any weight relief system so you get the full rock-solid power and tone of the original.</p><h3>Single-piece mahogany neck</h3><p>To create a confident playing feel, Gibson have fitted a single-piece mahogany neck using a solid mortise and tenon joint reinforced using Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive.

The new 114ce has a Grand Auditorium profile with a slick Venetian cutaway. Built using excellent quality materials, the 114ce is a sublime acoustic that responds to all styles of play making it a genuine all-rounder to have in your collection.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>The Grand Auditorium body shape was first introduced in 1994 and has remained a top choice for many musicians because it is so incredibly multifaceted. The 114ce also has a Venetian cutaway, offering not just a sleek appearance but this slope in the body provides full access to the neck.</p><p>Sitka Spruce is nearly always the choice of tonewood when it comes to making a Taylor acoustic, and this remains true in the 114ce. The top is reinforced with forward shifted pattern bracing which helps the guitar to sing with clarity and volume. The back and sides of the 114ce are made up of layered walnut, an exquisite tonewood which produces a versatile tonal range with deep lows, a punchy midrange and crisp highs.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>You can be sure that the 114ce feels just great to play thanks to the Taylor patented sapele neck. The neck has a narrower 1 11/16 inch nut width, facilitating those big bar chords and faster playing methods. The neck is topped with an ebony fingerboard which is home to 20 frets, and of course you have full access to these thanks to the body's Venetian cutaway. Each fret transition is guided by the 4mm dot Italian acrylic inlays.</p><h3>ES2 Pickup</h3><p>The natural voice of the 114ce acoustic is transferred beautifully via the onboard Expression System 2 pickup. This pickup is like no other due to its unique positioning behind the saddle. It features three individually calibrated sensors, and their placement means that each note played can be accurately and clearly heard. The pickup and Taylor's custom-designed """"professional audio""""-grade preamp work together to give the 114ce its phenomenal acoustic tones. Amend your sound to suit your playing needs using the simple controls for Tone and Volume.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>The Taylor 114ce offers tuning stability you can rely on thanks to the chrome tuners fitted to the headstock. The Tusq nut and Micarta saddle also work with the tuners to provide durability and enhanced sustain.</p><p>The neat, natural finish of the body come with matching slick appointments consisting of a three-ring soundhole rosette, black pickguard and black binding. Carrying the 114ce is made easy as Taylor include a lightweight protective gig bag with each one.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Taylor Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,1022-1022-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/e1054acdf3fa27b69faf5d517cb0d733.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Taylor 2017 114ce Walnut Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,Taylor 2017 114ce Walnut Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

However, this stripped back affair is just as much guts as it is glory, and perfect for those who want an affordable model to hit the stage with, whilst still retaining that classic Gibson look and feel.</p><h3>Classic design without frills</h3><p>At the heart of this model is the same classic tonewood setup that has been the driving force of the Les Paul's tone for decades - a solid mahogany body with a crisp maple top to supply an exquisite balance of power and precision. To increase playing comfort, the body has been treated to modern weight relief, which takes the back-breaking labour out of every performance, without compromising on that sumptuous Les Paul tone. As previously stated, the faded look may offer a less polished finish than that of pricier models, but it is in no way less eye catching. With a healthy lacquer to finish the job, you can rest assured that it will outshine all its rivals for years to come.</p><h3> Sturdy and responsive neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid maple neck, which has been treated to a slim taper profile to lend its support in creating the most comfortable playing experience. Married to the body is a sublime rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with dot position inlays to aid in your navigation. The single-cutaway body profile allows you to reach the upper frets with ease.</p><p>At the top of the neck you'll find the headstock, which is equipped with vintage-style keystone tuners to uphold tuning integrity with precision. The partnership of tuners and Tektoid nut stabilises string tension to maintain the playing feel across each string throughout even the most energetic of performances. Fitted to the body is an aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with steel thumbwheels, as well as an aluminium stop bar tailpiece with steel posts. The bridge and tailpiece work together harmoniously to optimise intonation and sustain by creating a seamless connection between strings and body.</p><h3>Upgraded electronics</h3><p>The Gibson Les Paul Faded T Electric Guitar is fitted with an impressive pickup pairing that includes a 490R in the neck position, and a 490T in the bridge position. Control over the pickups comes via independent volume and tone pots for each pickup, as well as a three-way selector switch. The range of tonal colours you have to paint with is astonishing, with murky muddy, fat saturated lows to impeccably polished highs that sing. Whatever style of music you are tackling, the Les Paul Faded T is more than capable of exceeding your expectations.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>To complete the package, the Gibson Les Paul Faded T Electric Guitar is supplied with a padded gig bag to protect your new pride and joy, as well as get you out on the road asap. Each model also comes with a strap and polishing cloth, to help keep your new guitar in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,528-528-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/7f55340c182cadef0202f6bce01d054d.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson Les Paul Faded T Electric Guitar - Worn Cherry,Gibson Les Paul Faded T Electric Guitar - Worn Cherry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The aesthetics are simple but make a statement with their stripped-back elegance, this is a bass for people who want great tone with a no frills attitude.</p><h3>Short-scale neck design</h3><p>The Gretsch G2220 Junior Jet Bass II is equipped with a shorter scale (30.3-inches) maple neck, which is more accommodating for players with a smaller reach and produces a focused, punchy midrange energy. The deep D neck profile guarantees a reassuringly substantial feel in the hand without becoming cumbersome or unwieldy. Paired with the neck is a cool rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 20-frets that bow to a graceful 12-inch radius to produce the smoothest of playing surfaces. The gloss urethane finish prevents unwanted wear and tear from affecting the playability of the neck.</p><h3>Comfortable single-cutaway body</h3><p>The body is built using basswood, a lightweight and tonally versatile wood that is perfect as the partner to the short-scale neck design. Matching comfortability with regard to weight, the body has been crafted using a single-cutaway to enable greater access to the upper frets, opening up the fingerboard in its entirety.</p><h3>Gretsch mini-humbuckers</h3><p>The two mini-humbucker pickups give a thick tone with great sustain and a hotter output, which will help get the best out of your amp, with a brighter output from the bridge pickup and a warmer response from the neck pickup. There are two knobs, volume and tone, so you can control your sound quickly without unnecessary complication.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The chrome hardware guarantees a clean look and complements the sleek black finish beautifully. The combination of four-saddle bridge and die-cast tuning machines works harmoniously to optimise intonation and sustain, whilst upholding tuning integrity with precision.

The body is home to the modern belly-down richlite bridge, which creates a seamless connection between the strings and body for optimised intonation and sustain. The result is a guitar that performs with consistency every time you pick up and play.</p><h3> L.R. Baggs Element VTC Pickup System </h3><p>Equipped with the award-winning L.R.

If playing guitar was a guilty pleasure, then the Explorer would make the ultimate indulgence. Fortunately, we don't need to excuse ourselves for wanting a piece of this beauty. Each model is supplied with a hardshell case and accessory kit from Gibson, so you can transport yours in safety and keep it in top condition as you go. Don't hang about, do yourself a favour and grab yours now!</p><h3>Striking body style</h3><p>Ever since its introduction, the Explorer has forged its own path. The angular shape is a far cry from the rounder-bodied guitars in the Gibson family, and though it was initially released several decades ago, it is still light years ahead of the rest. The body is crafted using mahogany, a solid tonewood that is highly regarded due to its impressive midrange clout and enduring sustain. The weight across the body and neck is finely balanced to create a comfortable feel in the hands, making it an effortless guitar to perform with.</p><p>The sublime antique natural finish is protected by a coating of gloss nitrocellulose lacquer, preserving the tonewood for as long as possible so that it can age gracefully.</p><h3>Solid and fast-playing neck</h3><p>The set-in mahogany neck is firmly joined to the body of the Explorer, equipping it with a reassuringly unyielding feel in the hand. The neck is shaped to the slimtaper profile to add speed and dexterity to its arsenal. Married to the neck is a torrefied granadillo fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are decorated with acrylic dot position inlays for guidance. The neck also features a Tektoid nut which lubricates itself, consequently improving sustain and ensuring accuracy when returning to pitch.</p><p>The body shape and neck profile partnership comes together beautifully to ensure that your fretting hand has access to each fret, affording total mastery the fingerboard. The result is a playing experience unlike any other.</p><h3>Mighty BurstBuckers</h3><p>To give the 2018 Explorer the tonal palette it deserves, Gibson USA have fitted a pair of their BurstBucker pickups, with a 2 in the neck position, and a 3 in the bridge position. Both pickups are modelled on the hallowed PAF pickups. However, the BurstBucker 3 has been overwound, which is essence gives it a much beefier and hotter output. Control over the pickups comes in the form of independent volume controls, a master tone that controls both, and a three-way pickup selector switch. The range of tones available to allows the Explorer to tackle any musical genre with ease. Dial it back for a smoother, less in-your-face response. Alternatively, ramp up the level, push your amp, and let loose some punishing riffs.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The headstock is fitted with the highly-reliable Mini Grover Kidney tuners that boast a 14:01 gear ratio, you can rest assured that your strings will stay in tune no matter what. The body is home to an aluminium Tune-O-Matic bridge, which is partnered with an aluminium stopbar tailpiece to provide the perfect anchor point for the strings to optimise intonation and sustain throughout every performance.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,564-564-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/62b097314c40ded9a452b387e3e6b466.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson USA 2018 Explorer Electric Guitar - Antique Natural,Gibson USA 2018 Explorer Electric Guitar - Antique Natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Delivering the lush tonal complexity of a hollowbody with the classic chime and jangle that comes with the increased string count, Gretsch has created a breath-taking model that is equally at home in the studio and on the stage. Packed with a pair of Blacktop Filter'Tron pickups, you can play the mesmerising timbre of the G5422TG-12 via an amplifier without making any compromise with regard to timbre.</p><h3> Bound thinline double-cutaway body </h3><p>The body has been shaped to that of a thinline hollowbody profile, which marries comfortability and tonal versatility beautifully. The 5-ply maple tonewood works harmoniously with the body profile to generate a confident midrange energy that has a softly rounded low end and sparkling brilliance across the upper frequencies.</p><p></p>As well as ensuring the timbre of the G5422TG-12 is second to none, the team at Gretsch have gone to great lengths to resurrect the vintage aesthetic of their historic models, whilst appointing modern touches to maintain a solid and stable playing feel. The body top incorporates stylish over-sized bound f-holes, which allow the timbre to ease through for a smooth yet subtle acoustic projection. The top is bound to offer protection to the edges and complement the finish. Protection is offered to the paintwork in the form of a slender yet resilient gloss finish. A gold plexi pickguard, complete with black Gretsch logo, resides just beneath the pickups to prevent unwanted nicks and scrapes from affecting the lower bout.<p></p><h3> Gloss-finished maple neck </h3><p>Joined to the body is a fast-playing, gloss-finished maple neck, which is shaped to a """"U""""-shape profile to create a comfortable feel in the hand. Paired with the neck is a 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which has been bound to guarantee seamless transitions between frets that are adorned with pearloid hump-block position inlays. The 12-inch fingerboard radius makes executing string bends are breeze, whilst the double-cutaway body profile means that each and every fret is within easy reach.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck you'll find a Graph Tech nubone nut, which works in partnership with the vintage-style open-back tuning machines to stabilise string tension and tuning integrity. Connected to the body is a smaller late-'50s G6120 bound headstock, which proudly shows off a white Gretsch logo. Fitted to the G5422TG-12 is an adjusto-matic bridge with a secured rosewood-base, which is paired with a Gretshc G-Cutout tailpiece. The hardware creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3> Blacktop Filter'Tron pickups </h3><p>Fitted to the body are two BlackTop Filter'Tron humbuckers in the neck and bridge positions. Designed to enhance the """"fat"""" timbre produced by the body, this pair produce an enviable tonal arsenal for you to play with. The neck position enhances the plucky articulation of the neck and fingerboard, whilst the bridge pickup draws more from the body, generating a thunderous charge when you want it.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of a three-way pickup selector toggle switch, which allows you to select either pickup independently or select both outputs simultaneously for a fuller tone. Each pickup has an independent volume knob, and both are connected to master volume and tone pots.</p><p>The Gretsch G5422TG-12 Electromatic hollowbody guitar is the perfect model for those who want the sparkling majesty of a 12-string in a model that is very comfortable to perform with, and offers a highly versatile tonal palette to paint with. Whether you're picking up your first model, or are a seasoned pro who is seeking a reliable touring partner, it doesn't get much better than this.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gretsch Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,637-637-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/116644b47b23a58401edae097403bfde.jpeg,1,,FALSE,G5422TG-12 12-String Electromatic Hollowbody - Black,G5422TG-12 12-String Electromatic Hollowbody - Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The S series of Ibanez guitars are incredibly well-designed, and the S670QM is just that. With its sculpted double cutaway body and a lightweight but sturdy build, the S670QM feels and sounds dreamy.</p> <h3>Body</h3> <p>As mentioned, the S670QM is shaped to the deep double cutaway shape which opens up access to the neck in its entirety. The body of the guitar sits well against the player, while its lightweight feel reduces fatigue onstage. The body is constructed from mahogany, producing rich, warm tones with clarity. Plus, the body features a quilted maple top that shines radiantly through the eye-catching finish.</p> <h3>Neck</h3> <p>The S670QM is fitted with a smooth maple neck which features the signature Ibanez Wizard III profile. The Wizard III neck is thin and flat which promotes faster playability. A bound rosewood fingerboard tops the neck which feels just right in the hand, facilitating grip and fret transitioning. The fingerboard hosts 24 frets, meaning you have a two-octave fretboard to explore fully. Offset white dot inlays decorate the frets to guide you along.</p> <h3>Quantum Pickups</h3> <p>The S670QM Spot Run is powered by a superb trio of Quantum pickups. The neck and bridge positions feature ceramic humbucking Quantum pickups, while the middle position employs an Alnico-powered Quantum single-coil pickup. The fusion of humbuckers and a single-coil pickup opens up a whole universe of tones, whether you're tearing out solos or using their responsive bass / midrange tones for complex chording.</p> <p>Master Volume and Tone controls allow you to shape your sound with precision, while a 5-way pickup switch blends and separates the pickups.</p> <h3>Hardware and Finish</h3> <p>The S670QM is fitted with an excellent Edge-Zero II tremolo bridge with a stud lock function that improves tuning stability even after plenty of heavy tremolo use. The tuners at the headstock also work alongside the bridge to ensure that each string remains in tune.</p> <p>The spectacular finish of this Spot Run model is matched up with Cosmo Black hardware. The S670QM Spot Run is yet another high quality electric guitar hailing from the Ibanez S line of first-rate instruments to appeal to the masses.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Ibanez Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,818-818-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/7e0ab3a224222473a6779ae084cd8331.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Ibanez S670QM Electric Guitar - Dragon Eye Burst,Ibanez S670QM Electric Guitar - Dragon Eye Burst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The limited-edition model features an exclusive green Anaconda Burst finish, which accentuates the two-piece figured maple top beautifully. As one of a very limited number of models to be numbered and signed by Slash, you can rest assured that you are getting a truly unique addition to your collection.</p><h3> Classic Les Paul design </h3><p>As one might expect, the Gibson Custom Slash Les Paul adheres strictly to the traditional Les Paul body design, which has laid the foundation of Slash's tone for decades. The body is built using lightweight solid mahogany, which establishes a rich and warm foundation. As noted above, the top is crafted from two-piece figured maple, which ensures that the mid to high notes ring out with the utmost clarity. The heavenly Anaconda Burst finish is protected by a layer of nitrocellulose lacquer, to maintain its pristine condition for many years to come.</p><h3> Sturdy yet supple neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid mahogany neck, which is connected via a long tenon joint for improved sustain, and reinforced using a hide glue fit. The neck is shaped to a custom Slash taper, with a .910-inch depth at the 1st fret extending to a 1.05-inch depth at the 12th fret. No introduction need be made with regard to Slash's mastery of the guitar, but suffice it to say that if his own custom profile is good enough for him, it is good enough for the rest of us.</p><h3> Fast and free fingerboard </h3><p>Paired with the neck is a luxurious rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. Thanks to the customary single-cutaway body profile of the Les Paul, every fret is within easy reach so that you can comfortably noodle your way to the highest reaches of the fingerboard. Binding guarantees that seamless transition between frets are the norm, removing unwanted obstacles to maximise that lightning fast playing feel.</p><h3> Slash Signature Seymour Duncan pickups </h3><p>It is only fitting that the Gibson Custom Slash Les Paul be equipped with Slash's Signature Seymour Duncan APH-1 and APH-2 pickups. Since the recording of the seminal Guns N' Roses' album """"Appetite for Destruction"""", Slash has favoured the APH-1, with Seymour Duncan creating the APH-2 in its visage. The intensity of Slash's playing style is magnified when these pickups are cranked, but also retain a subtlety when rolled back during more intimate moments. Control over the pickups comes in the form of 500K CTS Volume and Tone pots, with hand-wired harness that feature Sprague Orange Drop capacitors, so that no matter how minor the attenuation, you have the smoothest of control with absolute precision. A Switchcraft toggle switch affords the same level of precision when changing between the bridge and neck pickups.</p><h3> Immaculate hardware </h3><p>The body is home to a nickel-finished lightweight aluminium ABR-1 bridge, which creates a seamless transition between strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain.

The Axcess Standard adheres closely to the solidbody brilliance of the LP, but makes it even more of a joy to wield thanks to an improved neck heel design. The inclusion of the enigmatic Floyd Rose tremolo offers peerless vibrato control. Put it all together, and you've got a pro-level guitar that is destined for greatness.</p><h3> Maple and mahogany partnership</h3><p>A dominant feature often found in Les Paul guitars is the combination of maple and mahogany in the body. The Les Paul Axcess Standard has a carved maple top, which is finished in a glorious Iced Tea that is protected by a slender layer of gloss. Paired with the maple top is a solid mahogany body, which establishes a firm, resounding midrange timbre. Modern weight-relief has been employed to take the heavy feel out of the guitar, giving you the best of both worlds - unrelenting sustain with a lightweight playing feel. Whether you're laying down licks in the studio or wowing your adoring fans on the stage, you can do it in style without the back ache.</p><h3>Solid mahogany neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid mahogany neck, which is shaped to a rounded profile that extends to a contoured rib-cage heel cut. The heel design enables the body of the guitar to rest snugly against you for increased playing comfort. Married to the neck is a heavenly 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which offers a wonderful playground for your fingers to explore. As always, the sleek single-cutaway design affords easier access to the upper frets to give you total mastery over the fingerboard.</p><h3>Beautiful 496R AND 498T pickups</h3><p>The 496R and 498T pickups are a pair of hot humbuckers which really help your tone shine through this solidbody electric guitar. They are powerful and energetic pickups which have incredible sustain and a lot of bite that can add definition to your sound. The pickups are wax-potted to completely reduce any possible feedback and both pickups allow you to play anything from bright, clean tones to crunchy rock.</p><p>Individual volume and tone controls for each pickup allow you to shape and carve out your tone to perfection, whilst a three-way pickup selector switch enables you to choose either independently or both simultaneously. Whether you're performing fat and thick bluesy numbers, tight and articulate jazz, or in your face rock and metal, the Les Paul Axcess Standard is equipped to do it all.</p><h3>Hardware and finish</h3><p>The Les Paul Axcess Standard is fitted with a Floyd Rose tremolo bridge and tailpiece with an R4 locking nut, which allows you to dive and wail to your heart's content. The sturdiness of this design is truly remarkable, and you can rest assured that no matter how much abuse you give it, the bridge and tailpiece will bounce back in style every time.</p><p>The Gibson Les Paul Axcess Standard is a breath-taking model which brings together a partnership of traditional features and modern upgrades to bring the Les Paul guitar right up to scratch in our present day. To keep the Axcess protected and in as good as new condition, Gibson supply a hardshell case with every model, as well as a certificate of authenticity.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,531-531-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/1fd291905305b2fe5129b8c18b56a7d8.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson Les Paul Axcess Standard Floyd Rose Electric Guitar - Iced Tea,Gibson Les Paul Axcess Standard Floyd Rose Electric Guitar - Iced Tea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

It is built using tonewoods of the highest quality and plays host to a wealth of beautiful finishing touches.</p><p></p><p>The Taylor 320 has been built with a dreadnought body shape, which is noted for its ability to project a powerful sound. It responds well over a wide dynamic range, boosting the signal of gentler players and yielding a high quality of articulation to more aggressive strummers and pickers. This makes the dreadnought shape perfect for big hitters who want a guitar that will accentuate their sound, rather than drown it out.</p><p>The top wood is built using Solid Tropical Mahogany, a dense tonewood that delivers a very bright and punchy sound. The Mahogany top gives a short and snappy tone to the guitar but throughout its life can develop into an incredibly warm and natural soundboard. It is well suited to players who are looking for a tone with plenty of individuality and attitude. The top is reinforced with forward-shifted bracing that features Taylor's patented relief rout. The relief rout allows the stiff mahogany to resonate with greater flexibility, without sacrificing structural integrity. Therefore, the 320 can produce huge amounts of sound when required.</p><p>The back and side wood of the 320 is built using West African Sapele wood, which has been utilised by Taylor for over a decade. Sapele is known for having similar harmonic qualities to mahogany in delivering soothing lows and warm mid tones. It is a very-adaptable tonewood that supports a variety of styles from fingerstyle to strumming.</p><p>The combination of the mahogany top and sapele back and sides creates a guitar with a high degree of low-end depth that is matched with a bright and snappy upper midrange. The body is bound in black to protect the edges from chips and damage. A black pickguard protect the top of the body beneath the strings.</p><p>The neck is constructed from reassuringly unyielding Tropical Mahogany, which is set to a 25-1/2"""" scale length. Coupled with an Ebony fingerboard - that is home to 20 frets - the sonic properties of both woods marry together beautifully to complete the delivery of superbly resonant tones with the softened mid range.</p><p>The strings are held in tune by Taylor's reliable chrome tuners, and meet the body via the Tusq nut and saddle who both ensure string action integrity is acutely maintained.</p><p>The Taylor 320 top, back, sides and neck are all protected with a satin finish. This is durable enough to withstand minor scratches and scrapes whilst remaining thin enough to allow the wood to resonate without being impeded. The headstock overlay is fashioned from Indian Rosewood.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Taylor Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,1067-1067-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/9539844c62375baf187069ef123d5ea8.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Taylor 320 Acoustic Guitar - Natural,Taylor 320 Acoustic Guitar - Natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The 816e electro-acoustic guitar is a perfect example of what they're capable of; combining superb tonewoods, solid build quality and an electronics system that compliments the timbre of the guitar excellently, to create a sublime instrument that is studio and stage ready. The 816e is shaped to the Grand Symphony body, serving up a powerful acoustic voice thanks to its wide wait and larger lower bout. If you're a player that prefers to strum or pick their guitar with vigour, but don't want to compromise on sound quality or articulation, then the Grand Symphony body is perfect. Even fingerstyle players will appreciate the dynamic range offered by this shape, as deft finger picking is represented well with wonderfully lush tones.</p><p>The Taylor 816e body back and sides have been crafted from Indian Rosewood, a delightfully rich and complex tonewood that produces a full and robust mid to low-end force. The top is made from Sitka Spruce - a Taylor favourite - due to its excellent resonant properties that allow it to project huge sounds with the greatest of ease. The bright-sounding Spruce works wonderfully with the Rosewood and body shape to create an incredibly complex tonal palette.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>The body has been given a gloss finish to protect from unwanted nicks and scrapes that come through playing. It also enables the guitar to cope with changes in humidity and temperature capably, making this a fantastic touring and gigging partner.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>The neck is made from Tropical Mahogany, given it a reassuringly sturdy feel in the hand. Married to the Mahogany is a sumptuous Ebony fingerboard, giving a delightfully playable surface to navigate along. The Mahogany and Ebony combine perfectly to create a highly resonant platform for the strings, guaranteeing that every note rings out with the utmost clarity. The neck has been treated with a satin finish to give it a smooth playing feel, even after hours on stage.</p><h3>Electronics</h3><p>The 816e electro-benefits from Taylor's newly designed Expression System 2 (ES2), their behind-the-saddle pickup and custom-designed """"professional-audio""""-grade preamp. As part of their never-ending quest for better tone, they shifted their usual 'under-the-saddle' design as they found that by placing the pickup behind-the-saddle, a less brittle, brash and synthetic sound could be captured. This means that no matter how aggressively you play, the natural warmth produced by the tonewoods rings out beautifully.</p><p>The control layout features the same volume and tone control knobs as on the original Expression System, with Taylor changing the gain structure of the preamp slightly to make it a little hotter. When playing live, this subtle adjustment gives the 816e the boost you need to be heard loud and clear.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>High-quality hardware is used throughout to ensure a professional-level finish is achieved. Taylor nickel tuners work in partnership with the Tusq nut and Miscarta saddle to ensure tuning integrity, string tension and the string's connection to the body is perfectly maintained. A Maple .080"""" binding, which also enhances the stunning natural grain of the tonewoods, protects the body edges.</p><p>The impressive Taylor 816e also comes with its very own Taylor Deluxe Hardshell Brown case, perfect for transporting this beauty between your home, the studio and to gigs. If you're looking for a fantastic all-rounder that can produce enormous tones, then this is the partner for you!</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Taylor Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,1091-1091-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/b36b4e15e506429ef629a9f27625e695.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Taylor 816e Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,Taylor 816e Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Though it has long been associated with hard rock and metal, it is a much more versatile instrument that is well suited to a wide range of other styles from jazz to blues, prog and grunge. The 2017 HP (High Performance) model is endowed with a selection of premium appointments that makes this the perfect choice for professionals who want a powerful workhorse that is built for life on the road.</p><h3>The Flying V</h3><p>Just looking at the Flying V, it becomes immediately clear as to where its name comes from. Multi-cut mahogany has been employed as the body tonewood, giving the V a commanding mid to low-end energy. Though it comes in at under 4lbs, the guitar produces an enduring sustain. As with other models in the 2017 range, Gibson has increased the comfortability of the guitar by including a sculpted fast-access heel. This accompanies a flat carve body contour and makes it even more enjoyable to wield.</p><h3>Slimtaper Flying V profile</h3><p>Securely fitted to the V-shape body - via a traditional Mortis and Tenon joint with Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive reinforcement - is a single-piece mahogany neck. Shaped to the Flying V slimtaper profile, Gibson have designed this neck with soloists in mind to be a fast and smooth playing dream. Married to the neck is a 22-fret grenadillo fingerboard, which is decorated with Mother-of-Pearl dot inlays to conduct your way up and down the frets with confidence.</p><p>At the top of the neck is an innovative titanium zero-fret adjustable nut, which couples exceptional sustain with outstanding resonance for a rich, full-bodied tone. The zero-fret nut also gives the neck and strings the fastest action to date, perfect for rock guitarists who play at break-neck speeds.</p><h3>Dirty Finger+ pickups</h3><p>The Dirty Fingers+ humbuckers are Ceramic magnet-powered high gain monsters that deliver searing tones to die for. These beauties are perfect for taking centre stage, with a loud and aggressive edge that pushes amps hard - making them a fantastic partner for your tube/valve amp. Beefing up the sustain generated by the body/neck combo, the Dirty Fingers+ sing with absolute clarity.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of newly designed knurled knobs, with added grip to ensure greater precision when making tonal adjustments during energetic sets.</p><h3> Improved G-FORCE auto-tuning </h3><p>Gibson has equipped the 2017 Flying V HP with an updated version of their G-FORCE auto-tuning system. This sits at the back of the headstock, and gives you access to alternate tunings and adjustment with greater speed and accuracy. The improved synchronized spur gear system operates smoothly and quietly, and boasts a highly impressive 40:01 gear ratio - you can rest assured that once your tuning is set, it will remain that way no matter how hard you rock out.</p><h3>Stage-ready hardware</h3><p>The Gibson 2017 Flying V HP is fitted with a chrome-plated Tune-o-Matic bridge with titanium saddles and locking thumbwheels, which is paired with a chrome-plated aluminium stopbar tailpiece with locking studs. The titanium saddles further enhance the sustain and helps to produce a crystal clear, bright sound.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>Each Gibson 2017 Flying V HP Electric Guitar model is supplied with a hardshell case in aluminium to protect your pride and joy whether it is in storage or in transit. With the 2017 model you will also receive a Gibson USA multi tool, premium strap, polishing cloth, and owner's manual to help you to keep your Flying V in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,441-441-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/b67b0ec545a30b30105bb7fb6d30faf1.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson 2017 Flying V HP Electric Guitar,Gibson 2017 Flying V HP Electric Guitar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Whatever style of music you're tackling, the 2017 EB Bass is a mighty performance partner for both amateur and professional players alike.</p><h3> Sophisticated EB profile </h3><p>Swamp ash is the tonewood of choice, and is perfect as the driving power behind the EB Bass. Highly regarded thanks to its rich warmth and depth of tone, Swamp Ash also boasts a relatively lightweight feel along with its big-hearted tone. The body is treated to a deep double-cutaway profile, making easy to reach the upper frets in comfort. The body has a contoured edge, which creates a comfortable rest for the picking arm, and allows the body to sit snugly against your body during performances.</p><h3> Robust rounded neck </h3><p>The neck is crafted using maple, which is shaped to a rounded profile to offer a substantial feel in the hand. Maple offers a bright counterpoint to the swamp ash to offer articulation across each and every note. Married to the neck is a sumptuous rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 24 frets that are adorned with dot position inlays to guide your way in style. The generous 34-inch scale length of the neck is paired with a 12-inch fingerboard radius, laying the foundation for an accommodating playing surface for your fingers to explore.</p><h3> EB Rhythm and Lead Humbuckers </h3><p>With a tone wood combo as potent as this, some equally powerful pickups are in order. Two Alnico V magnet-powered humbuckers are equipped, which deliver a high-gain output with fat tone. Each of these has its own volume control, so that tones can be blended from each pickup, whilst a master tone pot allows you to embellish output from low to high frequencies.</p><h3> Stage-ready hardware </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a Babicz full-contact bridge, which creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain. The headstock is home to Grover tuners which provide stability throughout the most energetic of performances with a durable 20:01 tuning ratio. The newly appointed self-lubricating TekToid nut also works tirelessly to upheld sustain and pitch accuracy.</p><h3> Included Accessories </h3><p>The Gibson 2017 EB Bass 4 String T Bass Guitar is supplied with a Gibson EVF gig bag to protect your pride and joy at home and on the move. Along with the gig bag, each model is supplied with a Gibson USA guitar strap, polishing cloth, truss rod wench, and 2.5mm adjustment wrench to help you keep your EB Bass in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,414-414-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/0154a3587f2f83686682e634a0d0cc04.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson 2017 EB Bass 4 String T Bass Guitar - Natural Satin,Gibson 2017 EB Bass 4 String T Bass Guitar - Natural Satin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Delivering the lush tonal complexity of a hollowbody with the classic chime and jangle that comes with the increased string count, Gretsch has created a breath-taking model that is equally at home in the studio and on the stage. Packed with a pair of Blacktop Filter'Tron pickups, you can play the mesmerising timbre of the G5422TG-12 via an amplifier without making any compromise with regard to timbre.</p><h3> Bound thinline double-cutaway body </h3><p>The body has been shaped to that of a thinline hollowbody profile, which marries comfortability and tonal versatility beautifully. The 5-ply maple tonewood works harmoniously with the body profile to generate a confident midrange energy that has a softly rounded low end and sparkling brilliance across the upper frequencies.</p><p></p>As well as ensuring the timbre of the G5422TG-12 is second to none, the team at Gretsch have gone to great lengths to resurrect the vintage aesthetic of their historic models, whilst appointing modern touches to maintain a solid and stable playing feel. The body top incorporates stylish over-sized bound f-holes, which allow the timbre to ease through for a smooth yet subtle acoustic projection. The top is bound to offer protection to the edges and complement the finish. Protection is offered to the paintwork in the form of a slender yet resilient gloss finish. A gold plexi pickguard, complete with black Gretsch logo, resides just beneath the pickups to prevent unwanted nicks and scrapes from affecting the lower bout.<p></p><h3> Gloss-finished maple neck </h3><p>Joined to the body is a fast-playing, gloss-finished maple neck, which is shaped to a """"U""""-shape profile to create a comfortable feel in the hand. Paired with the neck is a 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which has been bound to guarantee seamless transitions between frets that are adorned with pearloid hump-block position inlays. The 12-inch fingerboard radius makes executing string bends are breeze, whilst the double-cutaway body profile means that each and every fret is within easy reach.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck you'll find a Graph Tech nubone nut, which works in partnership with the vintage-style open-back tuning machines to stabilise string tension and tuning integrity. Connected to the body is a smaller late-'50s G6120 bound headstock, which proudly shows off a white Gretsch logo. Fitted to the G5422TG-12 is an adjusto-matic bridge with a secured rosewood-base, which is paired with a Gretshc G-Cutout tailpiece. The hardware creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3> Blacktop Filter'Tron pickups </h3><p>Fitted to the body are two BlackTop Filter'Tron humbuckers in the neck and bridge positions. Designed to enhance the """"fat"""" timbre produced by the body, this pair produce an enviable tonal arsenal for you to play with. The neck position enhances the plucky articulation of the neck and fingerboard, whilst the bridge pickup draws more from the body, generating a thunderous charge when you want it.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of a three-way pickup selector toggle switch, which allows you to select either pickup independently or select both outputs simultaneously for a fuller tone. Each pickup has an independent volume knob, and both are connected to master volume and tone pots.</p><p>The Gretsch G5422TG-12 Electromatic hollowbody guitar is the perfect model for those who want the sparkling majesty of a 12-string in a model that is very comfortable to perform with, and offers a highly versatile tonal palette to paint with. Whether you're picking up your first model, or are a seasoned pro who is seeking a reliable touring partner, it doesn't get much better than this.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gretsch Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,639-639-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/3c3acf514d2f4604b560365061d87a81.jpeg,1,,FALSE,G5422TG-12 12-String Electromatic Hollowbody - Walnut,G5422TG-12 12-String Electromatic Hollowbody - Walnut,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Adhering to the classic semi-hollowbody design, this legendary model is perfect for those who want their performance to truly shine.</p><h3>Sumptuous body design</h3><p>Since its release back in the late '50s, the ES-335 has found its way into the hands and hearts of players across many genres. Closely associated with blues, the ES-335 has been favoured by many rock players too, thanks to the innovative centre-block design that enables amplification without the unwanted noise or feedback. The body is constructed using 3-ply maple/poplar/maple for the top, back and sides, which creates a beautifully balanced tonal palette, as well as a lightweight feel in the hands. Spruce bracing ensures that the body top can resonate freely, whilst preventing buckling or warping from occurring over time.</p><h3>Supple yet supportive neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a heavenly maple neck, which is shaped to the rounded """"C"""" profile for a reassuringly comfortable grip. The rolled binding enables seamless transitions along the neck for a speedy playing feel. The neck is paired with a luxurious rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with pearloid dot position inlays to guide your way in style. For those who like to lay out their chops with a free-flowing feel, it doesn't get much more accommodating than with this setup.</p><h3>Burstbucker pickups</h3><p>Gibson has equipped the 2018 ES-335 Dot with Burstbucker pickups, which translate the lushly textured timbre of the guitar superbly when amplified. The acoustic response is captured in all its glory, whilst the pickups beg to be given an overdriven nudge to really bring out the best in this awesome guitar. Control comes in the form of independent volume and tone pots for each pickup, as well as a three-way pickup selector switch. Fat and bluesy to tight and articulate, these beauties are as versatile as they are powerful. The hand-wired electronics with ceramic capacitors ensure that any attenuation is done with absolute subtlety.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The body is equipped with an ABR-1 bridge that features plated brass saddles, which is paired with a die-cast zinc tailpiece. The result is a lightweight yet exceptionally strong and reliable system to uphold intonation and sustain across each and every string. The headstock is home to Grover 102 Rotomatic tuning machines, which maintain tuning with steadfast dedication. You can bend the strings to your heart's content, safe in the knowledge that they will keep coming back for more.</p><p>Each Gibson Memphis 2018 ES-335 Dot Electric Guitar is supplied with a hardcase to protect your model at home and on the go, as well as an accessory kit to help keep it in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,538-538-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/4b06674c50c0a9f105a1cb05d2b05f0e.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson Memphis 2018 ES-335 Dot Electric Guitar - Wine Red,Gibson Memphis 2018 ES-335 Dot Electric Guitar - Wine Red,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

One of the first solidbody guitars became an overnight success much to Gibson's surprise, and this was the now renowned Firebird. This astonishing guitar was the brainchild of car designer Ray Dietrich who worked alongside Ted McCarty (the then Gibson President). With its unique shape derived from car tailfins, this new Gibson was a revolution, and the 2017 Traditional rendition keeps many of the original historic features with some added new and exclusive appointments.</p><h3>BODY</h3><p>Unlike guitars at the time of its birth in the early 1960s, the Firebird had a reverse-style body and a longer right horn, which it retains today. The neck-through-body is constructed from mahogany, a preferred tonewood for Gibson. The mahogany body feels lightweight and comfortable, reducing fatigue especially for performers and live musicians.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>As mentioned, the 2017 Firebird T has a neck-through-body construction, which boosts sustain and grants full access to all the frets, even the upper registers. The neck is made up of mahogany and walnut and shaped to the classic Firebird Slim Taper profile for a faster, more comfortable playing feel in the hand of a modern guitarist.</p><p>The neck is topped with a thicker rosewood fingerboard providing you with 22 frets to enjoy. The use of this thicker rosewood boosts tonal depth produced by the guitar for a high quality sound output. Gibson have fitted a Tektoid nut that is self-lubricating for a better return to pitch and improved sustain.</p><h3>ELECTRONICS</h3><p>The 2017 Firebird T is equipped with a pair of Mini Humbucker pickups, with one in the neck position and another in the bridge position. The original Firebirds were also fitted with this superb pickup duo, and the 2017 version will still deliver those PAF-style authentic Gibson tones.</p><p>Featuring the usual controls for rhythm and lead Volume and Tone and a 3-way toggle pickup switch, you can shape your tone to suit your playing needs. Each control has a black tophat with a silver insert, complementing the body finish.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The Firebird T headstock is directly fitted with the exceptional Steinberger Gearless tuning keys set to a 40:01:00 gear ratio. Their rare design and precise ratio ensure consistency in tuning each string as well as improving the overall sustain.</p><p>To further boost sustain and resonance there is a traditional chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge and an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece.</p><p>To protect and complement the body's smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer finish is a 3-ply white Firebird pickguard with the quintessential gold Firebird on it. To enable the guitarist to look after this wonderful guitar as best as possible, Gibson include a brown Firebird hardshell case, premium strap and polishing cloth.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,435-435-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/fb9aa505ad613e1b714e74170a2b4f40.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson 2017 Firebird T Electric Guitar,Gibson 2017 Firebird T Electric Guitar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Now the guys at Gibson Custom have brought it back with historically accurate appointments to give you a reincarnation that is as close to the original as possible. This was one of the first Gibson sunburst models which has since become legendary and this new version brings it right up to date.</p><h3>MAPLE AND MAHOGANY</h3><p>In 1958 when Gibson first designed the original Les Paul Standard guitars, they would all feature a two-piece maple body top, and the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard indeed has a two-piece figured maple top. Figured maple is instantly eye-catching due to its flame-like texture while it also contributes to producing that vintage, '58 sound of the original.</p><p>The top is accompanied by mahogany in the back and sides which makes for the perfect partnership with the figured maple top to produce a strong, resonant output as authentic as those models which were first released in the late 50s. This version is given the 1950s style Les Paul body contour with no weight relief for a historically correct feel.</p><h3>VINTAGE CORRECT NECK</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard is fitted with a single-piece mahogany neck with a comfortable 1950's style Les Paul profile. It is firmly joined to the body using hot hide-glue which was a constitutional element of the original guitars. The neck also has a historic long-tenon neck joint which enables the guitar to precisely convey its classic tone.</p><p>Aboard the neck is a solid, one-piece Indian rosewood fingerboard which assists the mahogany in providing an all-round Les Paul sound. With 22 frets at your service, you can work your way up and down the neck in confidence thanks to the cellulose Trapezoid inlays.</p><h3>CUSTOM BUCKER PICKUPS</h3><p>Gibson have employed Custom Bucker pickups in the electronics of the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard, and consider them to be their best replica of PAF pickups yet. The Custom Buckers achieve an output that is as close to the original sound of a '58 guitar as you can imagine. Each pickup is powered by Alnico III magnets which deliver you a mix of epic ringing or deep rumble depending on the sound output that you require.</p><p>To help you control the rhythm and lead pickups, the guitar is fitted with two Volume and two Tone pots with matched 500k potentiometers and encased with gold top hats.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard has an ABR bridge with thumbwheels partnered with a lightweight aluminium stop bar tailpiece which enhances the overall intonation and sustain. At the top end of the guitar at the headstock we have reissue Kluson deluxe green keys made with nickel plated steel to uphold tuning integrity with accuracy.</p><p>Protecting the beautiful, hand-sprayed nitrocellulose finish on the body is a 1950's style cream pickguard which also really complements the guitar.

Through a combination of vintage-style and updated technology, Gibson has captured the vibrant energy and character of a classic Les Paul, whilst exceeding the tonal demands of guitarists all over the world.</p><h3>Unmistakable design</h3><p>As you'd expect, the body is crafted using classic combination of two-piece mahogany that has been combined with a grade A plain maple top. The maple doesn't just look pretty either; it lends itself to a sweetly delivered high-end that allows this beauty to truly sparkle. The body protected by a smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer, which preserves that natural grain and paintwork to allow your Les Paul to age gracefully. The 2018 Les Paul Classic also bypasses any weight relief system so you get the full rock-solid power and tone of the original.</p><h3>Single-piece mahogany neck</h3><p>To create a confident playing feel, Gibson have fitted a single-piece mahogany neck using a solid mortise and tenon joint reinforced using Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive.

The crispness of the maple rings truly, offering a snappy juxtaposition to the warm, dense mahogany.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes via the pickup independent volume and tone controls, which allow you to sculpt and shape your tone with precision. Orange Drop capacitors ensure that the slightest of adjustments is executed as smoothly as possible, putting absolute tone control in your hands.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>The headstock is home to Grover's kidney style locking tuners with an impressive tuning ratio, so you can rest assured that no slipping will occur during any emphatic string bending.

The X Series combines excellent materials and techniques to design superb acoustic guitars that don't impact too heavily on your finances, making them more readily affordable for the majority of guitarists. The D12X1AE is an exquisite 12-string electro acoustic which has a full-bodied, warm sound that will completely fill the room.</p><h3>TOUGH DREADNOUGHT BODY</h3><p>The Martin D12X1AE is shaped to the customary dreadnought body profile which enables the 12 strings to vibrate freely offering an enhanced sustain and resonance as a result. This 12 string has a versatile tonal range with rich harmonics and a dynamic response. Martin have utilised a solid sitka spruce top to complement the body shape, and it is given extra tenacity by the A-Frame ''X-1'' bracing underneath.

The Fishman Sonitone pickup amplifies the distinctively warm acoustic tones of your 12 string guitar when plugged into an amp of your choice.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>To best maintain tuning precision and integrity, Martin have chosen to kit out the D12X1AE guitar with small chrome tuning keys. The black richlite bridge holds a firm connection with the strings so you can play for hours with confidence.</p><p>An eye-catching tortoise pickguard sits beneath the soundhole to protect the body against scratches but also provides a stunning contrast against the hand-rubbed natural finish.</p><p>The Martin D12X1AE is an exceptional 12 string model full of high-caliber sound features and made with top quality materials for a comprehensive and comfortable feel. This X Series 12 string guitar has been built to appeal to guitarists who are looking for something high quality but at a lower cost, so if you have a smaller budget this is the perfect choice and is sure to please!</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Martin Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,940-940-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/b792853f465203b93392055e198d2562.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Martin D12X1AE 12-String Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,Martin D12X1AE 12-String Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

One of the most radical features of the SG when it was first released was the double cutaway body, which is still the same today. The SG Standard HP is equipped with a fast access heel for exceptional, easy reach to every fret, further boosted by the double cutaway.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>A smooth, Soloist mahogany neck is fitted to the SG Standard HP, providing extra room to play with. The neck has a Slim Taper profile, a popular choice for those who have a preference towards a much faster playing style.</p><p>The neck is topped with a sumptuous, dark rosewood fingerboard with a 12 inch radius and 22 easy-to-reach frets. Classic Mother of Pearl trapezoid inlays decorate the frets, guiding you from one to the next with complete confidence. For unrestricted control over string action and better sustain there is a titanium zero-fret adjustable nut with locking feature.</p><h3>ELECTRONICS</h3><p>Gibson have employed a pair of classic humbucker pickups in the 2017 SG Standard HP, with a '57 Classic in the neck position and a '57 Classic + in the bridge position. The '57 Classic humbuckers are designed to accurately replicate the original PAF-style tone heard on the original SG models many years ago.</p><p>The controls follow suit on previous models, with four knobs for rhythm and lead Volume and Tone, plus a 3-way pickup toggle switch to shape your SG sound. With upgraded wiring for the 2017 model, the controls work brilliantly to offer the desired tone you're looking for. The chrome-plated knobs and switch tip are designed to improve grip, so even on a dark, hot stage you'll have no problem making adjustments.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>There is updated, modern chrome hardware featured on the SG Standard HP, from the bell-shaped truss rod cover, tuning keys, Gibson logo and crown on the headstock to the bridge, tailpiece and control knobs. The headstock is now fitted with an improved version of the G FORCE automatic tuning system. Retuning your strings is a doddle with this accurate system, plus it has been calibrated to prevent any unwanted noise or interference.</p><p>A traditional chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge is fitted to the lower bout of the body with titanium saddles joined by an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece with locking studs for top quality sustain and resonance.</p><p>The small teardrop pickguard is designed to both protect and complement the stunning finish of the SG Standard HP, while the white fingerboard binding on the neck also helps complete the look. Gibson include a premium Gibson aluminium hard case, strap and polishing cloth with the purchase of a 2017 SG Standard HP, enabling the new owner to keep it in the finest condition for years to come.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,492-492-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/d3e9ea98fe0b7357134472d81e560c7c.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson 2017 SG Standard HP Electric Guitar - Heritage Cherry,Gibson 2017 SG Standard HP Electric Guitar - Heritage Cherry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The team at Gibson Memphis have gone to great lengths to ensure that this model adheres to its traditional values, whilst providing today's players with everything they could desire to secure its legacy for years to come.</p><h3>Classic ES-330 body</h3><p>The top, back and sides are all constructed from 3-ply maple/poplar/maple, contributing to a rich and playful tonal palette from which to draw with. By using this 3-ply construction method, the body is afforded a lightweight feel, which makes it a joy to perform with. Whether you're tracking in the studio or taking to the stage, the 2018 ES-330 is the perfect playing partner. The body is equipped with spruce bracing to support the top, enabling it to resonate freely to deliver a power acoustic energy whilst preventing unwanted buckling from warping the top over time. The body has been finished in a gorgeous Sunset Burst, which is evocative of the classic era ES-330 models.</p><h3>Solid mahogany neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a quarter-sawn mahogany neck, which is shaped to the rounded """"C"""" profile to offer a reassuringly substantial feel in the hand. Married to the neck is a 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is home to pearloid small block inlays to guide you. The fingerboard has been treated with rolled binding to increase playing comfort and make transitions between frets as smooth as possible. The partnership between the neck and the fingerboard creates a playing feel that is the stuff dreams are made of.</p><h3>Versatile MHS P-90 pickups</h3><p>The Gibson 2018 ES-330 Hollowbody is home to a pair of Memphis Historic Spec P-90 pickups, which are modelled on those fitted in the original '50s models. The team at Gibson Memphis have gone to painstaking length to recreate the smooth output of the vintage P90s for the utmost articulation with an enviable warmth, resulting is a rich translation of the ES-330's acoustic timbre. Control over the pickups comes in the form of gold top hat knobs with hand-wired electronics and ceramic capacitors to guarantee the smoothest attenuation.</p><h3>Hardware and Finish</h3><p>Fitted to the body is an ABR bridge with updated titanium saddles to optimise performance. Paired with the bridge is a classic thinline trapeze tailpiece to complement the vintage aesthetic. The bridge and tailpiece partnership creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain. The headstock of this stunning model is fitted with vintage style tuners with oval buttons, which uphold tuning integrity with precision.</p><p>To complete this awesome package, the Gibson Memphis 2018 ES-330 Hollowbody Electric Guitar in Sunset Burst is supplied with a hardshell case and an accessory kit.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,554-554-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/e513b66e17fac0b8585a0c8ad5156ccc.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson Memphis 2018 ES-330 Hollowbody Electric Guitar - Sunset Burst,Gibson Memphis 2018 ES-330 Hollowbody Electric Guitar - Sunset Burst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

A Les Paul is always special and everything from the carefully selected tonewoods used to the enigmatic tones produced, each one is unique and stays true to the fine history of one of the most popular musical instruments ever produced. Gibson's Custom Shop team don't just create instruments, they create timeless works of art.</p><h3> Legendary Les Paul style </h3><p>The instantly recognisable single-cutaway Les Paul body profile combines power and elegance to perfection. The Custom Shop '59 Standard Historic model, is crafted using a single piece of hand-selected solid mahogany to lay the foundation for a thunderous energy that is infused with a penetrating warmth. Married to the body - using Franklin Titebond adhesive - is a heavenly two-piece book-matched flame maple top, which is bound in 50s' cream single-binding. The maple counters the dense mahogany by gently underpinning the low to mid-end clout, whilst introducing a softer upper-range with crispness and clarity.</p><p>The Custom Shop team has adopted the 1950s' style body contour to create a smooth and comfortable playing feel. Each model's finish is protected by a slender but resilient layer of nitrocellulose lacquer, which allows the wood to resonate unimpeded whilst shielding the beautiful grain from unwanted damage.</p><h3> Sturdy mahogany neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a single piece mahogany, which has been set using the historic long neck tenon and reinforced using hot hide glue for added strength. The long neck tenon joint is renowned for its superior sound transference, adding to the already impressive tones produced by this monster. Shaped to the '50s' profile with painstaking accuracy, the neck creates a substantial feel in the hand without becoming unwieldy. Paired with the neck is a sublime Indian rosewood fingerboard shaped to a 12-inch radius</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,518-518-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/30bebc721203e688acce86f6fc54bca9.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson CS 1959 Les Paul Standard Historic Electric Guitar,Gibson CS 1959 Les Paul Standard Historic Electric Guitar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The preamp has an LED display so you can easily see the battery status and tuning, even in a dark venue. You can take charge of your sound using the Tone and Volume controls. The preamp only requires two button cell 3v lithium batteries which will then give you around 300 hours of use; so you can be confident from the practice session through to the live gig.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>The headstock of the Academy 10e is fitted with dependable chrome tuners while the Nubone nut and Micarta saddle work well to uphold tuning and intonation.

However, Gibson have raised the stakes by making this model exceptionally comfortable, and boasts a playing feel that will have you never wanting to put this beauty down.</p><h3>Sophisticated Les Paul design</h3><p>The heart and soul of the Les Paul tone comes from its tonewoods, and a long standing partnership of mahogany and maple.

The partnership of tuners and Tektoid nut stabilises string tension to maintain the playing feel across each string throughout even the most energetic of performances. Fitted to the body is an aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with steel thumbwheels, as well as an aluminium stop bar tailpiece with steel posts. The bridge and tailpiece work together harmoniously to optimise intonation and sustain by creating a seamless connection between strings and body.</p><h3>Upgraded electronics</h3><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Tribute T is fitted with an impressive pickup pairing that includes a 490R in the neck position, and a 490T in the bridge position.

Smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer has been used to treat the wood to preserve the finish, allowing it to age gracefully. The more you play this beauty, the more its character can develop and shine.</p><h3> Improved neck profile </h3><p>Fitted to the body via a classic mortis and tenon joint is the single piece mahogany neck, which is reinforced using Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive for a firm and reassuring playing feel. A newly applied asymmetrical slimtaper neck profile provides a fast and comfortable playing feel, which is tailored to meet the demands of today's versatile players.</p><p>Married to the neck is a heavenly 22-fret rosewood fingerboard with a compound-radius and rolled binding to heighten playing comfort, speed, and string-bending ability. Navigating the fingerboard is aided by the trapezoid inlays and side dot fret markers.</p><h3> Resilient, stage-ready hardware </h3><p>The TekToid nut guarantees a flush seat for each string to ensure great sustain. The headstock is home to Grover locking kidney tuning machines with an impressive 18:01 gear ratio, which uphold tuning integrity resolutely throughout each performance.</p><p>The body is home to the aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with titanium saddles and locking thumbwheels, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar with locking studs. The bridge and tailpiece partnership works dutifully to ensure intonation and sustain is optimised so that your Les Paul sings beautifully, and with the richness it deserves.</p><h3>Burstbucker Pro humbucker pickups</h3><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Standard T Electric Guitar has been treated to a pair of Burstbucker Pro Rhythm and Lead humbuckers, fitted in the neck and bridge positions respectively. The Burstbuckers produce the same glorious Gibson tones we all know and love, with a little added bite compared to their model T counterparts.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of new push-pull knurled knobs, which are finished in chrome to accentuate the stunning body finish. The switchable functions on offer are: to Tap or Split either pickup; activate an integrated High Pass Filter; or introduce transient suppression. The range of tones on offer is truly staggering, and you'll wonder how you ever got by without this guitar in your arsenal during any studio session or tour.Included Accessories</p><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Standard T Electric Guitar is supplied with its very own Gibson hardshell aluminium case with plush lined interior. Additional accessories include the Gibson USA multi-tool, premium strap, and polishing cloth to keep your new pride and joy in pristine working condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,465-465-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/8b421e0ae41d954baa67a52e134d9479.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson 2017 Les Paul Standard T Guitar - Honey Burst,Gibson 2017 Les Paul Standard T Guitar - Honey Burst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Finally the pickup also has a Phase switch for feedback control, which is located on the preamp board inside the soundhole.</p><p>Other excellent components that help seal the exquisite playability, resilience and reliability of the 214ce include a Nubone nut and Tusq saddle, which work tirelessly to maintain string tension and intonation throughout each and every performance.

From its breath-taking tones to the sumptuous burst finish, the G2420 is quite simply a dream come true for both hollowbody purists and newcomers alike. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, you'll fall in love with this models comfortable playability, rich timbre, and versatile tonal offerings.</p><h3> Stylish Single-Cutaway </h3><p>The hollowbody is crafted using laminated maple, which resonates freely to generate a brilliant output with depth and power. Parallel tone bars are employed to reinforce the top, allowing it to vibrate freely to deliver a strong yet balanced timbre. As the wood is laminated, it holds up well with regard to changes in temperature and humidity, making it a fantastic gigging guitar thanks to its tonal consistency.</p><p></p>The body top is adorned with a pair of very stylish F-holes, which project the timbre with the utmost clarity. The vintage aesthetic of the Aged Brooklyn Burst finish evokes Gretsch's classic-era models, with elegant two-ply white and black body binding on hand to emphasise the sultry curves of this model.

The fingerboard is shaped with 12-inch radius, guaranteeing that string bends are executed smoothly, whilst your fingers are given a luxurious playground to explore. The single-cutaway body shape enables greater access to the upper frets, allowing you to make the most of every part of the neck.</p><h3> Versatile Broad'Tron Humbuckers </h3><p>The energy produced in the body is harnessed and translated beautifully by the Broad'Tron humbucking pickups. Specifically designed by the engineers at Gretsch for the Streamliner series, this high-output partnership delivers lows with a vigorous warmth, mids with a hearty attack, and highs that ring with a brilliant clarity. Whatever style of music you play; the Streamliner is as adaptable as your playing style demands.</p><p>Control comes in the form of independent volume controls for each pickup, a master volume pot, and a master tone pot.

Martin's innovation in the world of the humble acoustic guitar cannot be understated. As pioneers of the dreadnought guitar, X-bracing and the 14-fret guitar, it is only fair to say that the modern acoustic guitar would not exist in the form that it does without their developments, so for that Martin, we thank you.</p><p>The top is built from solid Sitka spruce, a fantastic North American tonewood that has the enviable combination of being lightweight whilst having exceptional resilience, strength and elasticity. Due to its superb resonant qualities, spruce enables the soundboard to project a big sound with ease. Thanks to the standard """"X"""" scalloped, forward shifted bracing pattern, the top is reinforced to prevent the chance of warping over time, but is able to resonate freely.</p><p>The back and sides of the guitar are built from genuine mahogany, the tonewood of choice in the manufacture of high-end acoustic guitars. Thanks to its natural warmth, the D-18 produces a rich, thumping mid to low-end energy that is the driving force of this acoustic's timbre.</p><p>The neck is cut to the modified low oval profile with performing artist taper to guarantee a reassuring feel in the hand without feeling cumbersome or bulky. Married to the neck is a solid black ebony fingerboard, which is home to a total of 20 frets, with 14 clear frets. Martin's """"old-style 18"""" position inlays provide a stylish navigational aid. The fingerboard width at the nut is 1-11/16"""" extending to 2-1/8"""" at the 12th fret. Although some fingerstyle players may prefer a 1-1/3"""" width at the nut, the guitar still accommodates fingerstyle beautifully.</p><p>The body top beneath the soundhole and along the lower bout is protected from pickscrapes that can occur during performances by a Delmar tortoise colour pickguard. The nickel open-geared tuning machines with butterbean knobs uphold tuning integrity with the utmost precision. The bone nut maintains string tension keenly, whilst the solid black ebony bridge provides a seamless connection between the strings and body for optimum intonation.</p><p>The body is bound by a tortoise colour trim, which encases the stunning natural finish in style. Protection has been given to the woods in the form of polished gloss with aging toner to the top, and polished gloss on the back and sides. Martin has developed their own unique recipe to guarantee the woods are protected from unwanted damage, temperature/humidity changes, without impeding the woods ability to resonate to their fullest.</p><p>The Martin D-18 dreadnought acoustic guitar is quite simply one of the finest acoustic guitar models available, built by a company who have been crating impeccable acoustic guitars since 1833. To ensure you model is kept safe and sound, Martin have included a deluxe hardshell case.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Martin Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,949-949-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/b4f1626116f9ac5c9152d94b472633d3.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Martin D18 Dreadnought Acoustic Guitar - Natural,Martin D18 Dreadnought Acoustic Guitar - Natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Aside from that fact it is also a great choice, offering a clear and precise tone, atop a blanket of warmth. The overall sound sits between the properties of maple and mahogany, being loud but mellow.</p><p>Martin's well-known guitar manufacturing expertise is also apparent with the Martin OXK Ukulele, as it sports solid sitka spruce braces and mahogany end blocks, which along with the hardness of the kao, result in a strong guitar that is capable of loud and lasting sustain.</p><h3>Strong and durable</h3><p>The stratabond neck of the Martin OXK Ukulele is known for being especially strong, and being joined to the body of the uke via a dove tail joint, ensures a sturdy instrument.

This new model features an increased scale length to the neck - 17"""" scale length - which greatly improves string sustain and resonance to create a fuller sound, increasing the upper frequency range without sacrificing the unique timbre of the ukulele.</p><p>The G9110-L is fitted with a Fishman KULA preamp system, which makes it an ideal instrument for performing musicians or recording artists who require a versatile instrument that can either be miked up and recorded acoustically, or a signal taken directly from the ukulele itself.</p><h3>Strong design, beautiful body</h3><p>The G9110-L body is composed solely of laminated mahogany. This gives it excellent resilience in handling changes in temperature and humidity - making it an excellent choice for players who intend to transport this ukulele around a lot. The mahogany contributes significantly to the well-formed tonal character exhibited by the G9110-L, delivering a balanced mid to low-end voice.</p><p>The body has been given a light - but robust - coating of open-pore semi-gloss with a honey mahogany stain. This gently accentuates the natural beauty of the tonewood whilst offering protection to keep it in pristine condition for as long as possible.</p><h3>Extended, comfortable neck</h3><p>As already mentioned, the neck receives an extension by 2"""" to give it an overall scale length of 17"""", giving the strings a greater distance to resonate, build a fuller sound and ring out more clearly. The higher frets give a greater depth of flavour to the already rich and versatile tones produced by the concert ukulele shape.

The 5-ply maple tonewood works perfectly with the body design to lay the foundation for a smooth midrange energy that offers a sweet bottom-end and sparkling yet softly rounded highs. The stylish over-sized bound f-holes that are shaped into the top, allow the acoustic timbre to ease through for a smooth, subtle projection. The top is bound to offer protection to the body edges, as well complementing the masterfully executed finish.

Fitted to the G5422TG is an adjusto-matic bridge with a secured rosewood-base, which is paired with a glorious Bigsby Licensed B60 vibrato tailpiece.

Designed to enhance the """"fat"""" timbre produced by the body, this pair produce an enviable tonal arsenal for you to play with. The neck position enhances the plucky articulation of the neck and fingerboard, whilst the bridge pickup draws more from the body, generating a thunderous charge when you want it.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of a three-way pickup selector toggle switch, which allows you to select either pickup independently or select both outputs simultaneously for a fuller tone. Each pickup has an independent volume knob, and both are connected to master volume and tone pots.</p><p>The Gretsch G5422TG Electromatic hollowbody guitar with Bigsby tailpiece is a divine model that is a joy to perform with.

Alongside vintage-style features resides modern appointments that make this model a truly outstanding work of craftsmanship. It doesn't get much closer to the original than the 2018 Les Paul Traditional. Accompanying the guitar is a Gibson hardshell case and accessory kit.</p><h3> Late '50s Les Paul design </h3><p>To uphold the substantial feel of the late '50s Les Paul, Gibson have kept this as a non-weight relieved model. The result is a substantial yet manageable feel in the hands, with an unbeatable sustain and warmth. The same single-cutaway profile that we've all come to know and love is present and correct.</p><p>The classic tonewood partnership of mahogany body with maple top has been retained too. However, this isn't any old maple, it is grade AA figured maple. The result is a weighty midrange foundation with a clean upper mid to high frequency articulation that shines through. From smooth blues licks to searing high-gain soloing, the heart of the Les Paul produces resounding tones to suit any musical style. The finish has been treated to a slender yet durable layer of gloss nitrocellulose lacquer to protect against premature wear.</p><h3> Classic rounded neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid mahogany neck, which has been shaped to the rounded profile - again, ensuring a substantial yet manageable feel in the hand. Married to the neck is a sublime 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with acrylic trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. Rolled-over-fret cream binding creates seamless transitions between each fret to create the smoothest feel possible.</p><h3> Resilient, stage-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck you'll find the Tektoid nut, which works tirelessly to maintain string tension. The headstock is angled to Gibson's customary 17-degrees to improve tuning stability, whilst the Gibson logo is proudly on display for all to see. The nickel-plated vintage-style keystone tuning machines boast an impressive gear ratio, allowing them to firmly secure your strings during each and every performance. The body is home to the ABR bridge, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar tailpiece to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3>Sublime BurstBucker pickups</h3><p>The Gibson 2018 Les Paul Traditional is equipped with Burstbucker 1 and 2 humbuckers, fitted in the neck and bridge positions respectively. The Alnico II-powered Burstbuckers translate the richness of the body tonewoods, and the articulation of the neck and fingerboard construction with impeccable clarity. Control over the pickups comes in the form of classic gold Top Hat knobs, which complement the stunning finish beautifully.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,582-582-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/5189b751b92ff726e72dea23b6cb4952.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson USA 2018 Les Paul Traditional Guitar - Heritage Cherry Sunburst,Gibson USA 2018 Les Paul Traditional Guitar - Heritage Cherry Sunburst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Don't let the diminuitive dimensions fool you however, this little beauty is equipped with electronics that allow you to go from the most intimate of stages to the grandest of stages. Coming into its 184th year, Martin know a thing or two when it comes to building durable guitars with the ability to endure, and the 00-17SE Black Smoke reaps the rewards of this experience.</p><h3>Grand Concert body</h3><p>The 00-17SE Black Smoke has been crafted to the Grand Concert body shape, which possesses a shallower depth than that of a dreadnought whilst retaining a full waist. The combination results in a body that offers exceptional playing comfort and is great for players with a shorter reach. The timbre produced is delivered with a deft articulation and is often favoured by fingerstyle players.</p><p>Martin has employed solid Sitka spruce as the tonewood of choice for the body top. Boasting the enviable combination of resilience, strength, and flexibility, Sitka is a dream soundboard that projects with graceful dexterity. To prevent unwanted buckling or warping, Martin's time-tested scalloped X-bracing is on hand to ensure that the soundboard is suitably reinforced whilst resonating unimpeded. Grained Ivoroid binding encircles the body top, which complements the cool Black Smoke finish beautifully.</p><p>The back and sides of the guitar are built using mahogany, a naturally dense and warm sounding wood that establishes a hearty mid to low-end timbre, which works well with the Grand Concert body shape to create a subtle tonal balance. The back and sides have been treated to a satin finish, which prevents tackiness from developing to ensure a smooth playing feel every time.</p><h3>Select hardwood neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a select hardwood neck, which is shaped to the modified low oval profile with a high-performance taper. The neck is designed to inspire a fast playing feel, which is enhanced by the addition of a protective satin coating. Married to the neck is a 20-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with Mother of Pearl inlays to guide your way in style.</p><h3> Versatile electronics </h3><p>The Martin 00-17SE Black Smoke is equipped with a Fishman Matrix VT Enhance bridge-plate mounted transducer, which ensures that the acoustic sound of your guitar is amplified transparently. The discreet Volume, Tone and Enhance Blend controls are mounted within the soundhole, and therefore no holes are cut into the body to establish an interface. The rich aesthetic and tonal character of your guitar is preserved in all its glory, whilst offering peerless responsiveness to your playing dynamics and feel.</p><h3>Durable hardware</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a modern straight-line rosewood bridge with drop-in compensated white Tusq saddle. The bridge/saddle partnership creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain. At the top of the neck you'll find the bone nut, which works alongside Golden Age Relic nickel tuning machines to uphold tuning integrity and string tension dutifully.</p><p>The Martin 00-17SE Grand Concert Electro Acoustic Guitar in Black Smoke is perfect for players of any musical style, for flat pickers and fingerstyle players alike. For solo shows, it offers a delightfully intimate sound, and thanks to the built-in Fishman electronics, you can rest assured that it can hold its own as part of any ensemble.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Martin Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,948-948-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/7f1db69ecf61cf149f71ca209fbdeb7a.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Martin 00-17SE Grand Concert Electro Acoustic Guitar - Black Smoke,Martin 00-17SE Grand Concert Electro Acoustic Guitar - Black Smoke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

For incredible tones, pro-level stage readiness and drop-dead gorgeous looks, the G5439T is an absolute must-have!</p><h3>Body</h3><p>The tonal versatility of the G5439T starts with the tonewood combination in the body. Dense basswood and bright-sounding maple have been employed to carry out the task of delivering a well-developed tonal output. The back is composed of a chambered basswood design, which creates a thick mid to low-end barrage with awesome levels of sustain. The arched maple top counters this with a distinctively bright and snappy charge.</p><p>The body is protected by a resilient coating of gloss polyurethane and gloss polyester, which both work hard to reduce the impact of wear and tear on the mouth-watering silver sparkle finish.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>The slender maple neck assures a supportive and reassuring feel whilst playing. The rosewood fingerboard creates a confident playing surface on which to flex your creative muscles. The 12"""" fingerboard radius is a string bender's dream, allowing smooth bends and reducing the chance of note drop-off. Together the neck and fingerboard woods deliver """"tight"""" note articulation and a generous 24.6"""" scale length for the strings to resonate along, improving the overall sustain significantly.</p><h3>Electronics</h3><p>Two BlackTop Filter'Tron humbuckers at the neck and bridge position give the G5439T a deliciously """"fat"""" sound. At the neck position, sparkling lead/rhythm tones can be plucked out with the greatest of ease. The bridge pickup gives a nice, thumping rumble, that is great for chunky blues and rock licks. Flick the 3-way pickup selector switch to the centre position to combine a bit of both pickups for a swelling, mid-laden tone.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>Here is where the fun begins! Fitted to the G5439T is an anchored Adjusto-Matic bridge with a Bigsby licensed B50 vibrato tailpiece, offering an unbelievable level of creative control over your tone. Personal inflections can be squeezed into every single note, allowing you to truly put your stamp on every performance.</p><p>Vintage-style tuning machines ensure that once you dial in the tuning you want, it stays that way no matter how much you rock out onstage. The synthetic bone nut keeps the string spacing in-check so you can rest assured that no amount of string bending will throw it out of whack.</p><p>The G5439T Pro Jet is a delight to the ears, a feast for the eyes and a dream to play. Fitted with D'Addario XL110 Regular Light strings, you're good to go as soon as you get it.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gretsch Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,652-652-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/ddc3a439afa92b2f54eafdca61c1a0d1.jpeg,1,,FALSE,G5439T Pro Jet Electric Guitar - Silver Sparkle,G5439T Pro Jet Electric Guitar - Silver Sparkle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The S series of Ibanez guitars are incredibly well-designed, and the S670QM is just that. With its sculpted double cutaway body and a lightweight but sturdy build, the S670QM feels and sounds dreamy.</p> <h3>Body</h3> <p>As mentioned, the S670QM is shaped to the deep double cutaway shape which opens up access to the neck in its entirety. The body of the guitar sits well against the player, while its lightweight feel reduces fatigue onstage. The body is constructed from mahogany, producing rich, warm tones with clarity. Plus, the body features a quilted maple top that shines radiantly through the eye-catching finish.</p> <h3>Neck</h3> <p>The S670QM is fitted with a smooth maple neck which features the signature Ibanez Wizard III profile. The Wizard III neck is thin and flat which promotes faster playability. A bound rosewood fingerboard tops the neck which feels just right in the hand, facilitating grip and fret transitioning. The fingerboard hosts 24 frets, meaning you have a two-octave fretboard to explore fully. Offset white dot inlays decorate the frets to guide you along.</p> <h3>Quantum Pickups</h3> <p>The S670QM Spot Run is powered by a superb trio of Quantum pickups. The neck and bridge positions feature ceramic humbucking Quantum pickups, while the middle position employs an Alnico-powered Quantum single-coil pickup. The fusion of humbuckers and a single-coil pickup opens up a whole universe of tones, whether you're tearing out solos or using their responsive bass / midrange tones for complex chording.</p> <p>Master Volume and Tone controls allow you to shape your sound with precision, while a 5-way pickup switch blends and separates the pickups.</p> <h3>Hardware and Finish</h3> <p>The S670QM is fitted with an excellent Edge-Zero II tremolo bridge with a stud lock function that improves tuning stability even after plenty of heavy tremolo use. The tuners at the headstock also work alongside the bridge to ensure that each string remains in tune.</p> <p>The spectacular finish of this Spot Run model is matched up with Cosmo Black hardware. The S670QM Spot Run is yet another high quality electric guitar hailing from the Ibanez S line of first-rate instruments to appeal to the masses.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Ibanez Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,816-816-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/68e8f60e9583e043e70dc2b71eb05242.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Ibanez S670QM Electric Guitar,Ibanez S670QM Electric Guitar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Whether you're new to the instrument, or are a seasoned pro, the Less Plus will blow you away.</p><h3> Classic Les Paul design </h3><p>The body has been crafted using a classic Gibson tonewood partnership with mahogany used in the back to create the robust mid to low-end growl, and figured maple top to add high end sensitivity and cut through with striking clarity. The mahogany has been treated to a traditional rout, which lightens the load of the Less Plus whilst retaining the tonewood's crucial timbre and power. The body is very easy to wield, which is great for beginners who are building up playing stamina. Touring player's backs will appreciate the weight relief too. The sublime Fireburst finish shines proudly - especially under hot stage lights -, whilst a protective layer of gloss lacquer keeps it preserved for years to come.</p><h3>Comfortable neck shape</h3><p>A hardy mahogany neck is fitted to the body, providing the perfect platform to run your hands along, with the rounded C profile delivering a substantial feel in the hand. Married to the neck is a sumptuous rosewood fingerboard, home to 22 highly playable frets, and bound to create a smooth playing feel. As with other 2015 models, the neck and fingerboard are now slightly wider (0.050 per side) in order to increase playing comfort and improve the execution of strings bends. Not only that, but every fingerboard is smoother thanks to a new sand/buffering application, as well as a new oil treatment.</p><h3>Peerless Gibson tones </h3><p>The Gibson USA 2015 Les Paul Less Plus has been fitted with a pickup complement of '57 Classic and '57 Classic Plus humbuckers in double black exposed coils - in the neck and bridge positions respectively. If you're not already familiar with these pickups, they're modelled closely on Gibson's coveted Patent Applied For (PAF) pickups. Based around an Alnico II magnet, the '57 Classic has balanced coils that give these beauties a slightly richer tone, whilst the enamel-coated wiring ensures that at higher gain, these two pups maintain their consistency very well. Gibson have enabled coil-splits on both pickups, allowing you to pull single-coil tones from the pickups and expand the tonal versatility of the '57s even further. Whatever style of music you play, you'll easily find the tone you want with these beauties.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The nickel tune-o-matic bridge upholds intonation rigorously and stop bar tailpiece, consistently providing a secure and anchored playing feel. The zero fret nut-patent applied for nut supports each string meticulously, assuring string tension no matter what tuning you select, or how hard you rock out.</p><h3>G Force tuning</h3><p>The Gibson G FORCE system allows you to tune your guitar easily, and quickly. The user interface features an LED display for each string, along with a simple menu layout for rapid navigation. Basic functions include: multi-string tuning - simply press the On button, strum all the strings once, and when all LEDs are green, all six strings are tuned; single-string tuning, which offers greater precision; tuning adjustment - scroll through tuning presets and select a different tuning to the one currently in use, G FORCE does the work for you; and finally you can return to standard tuning at any time easily. The G FORCE system is capable of executing many advanced functions including: saving customised tunings; adjusting individual strings rapidly; and even has a capo mode, which accurately tunes each string with reference to capo placement on the 1st to 6th frets - simply amazing!</p><p>Each model is supplied with a hardshell case that cradles your Less Plus snugly, keeping it safe from harm whether it's kept at home, in the studio, or on the road.</p><p>The Gibson USA 2015 Les Paul Less Plus is incredibly impressive. Reliable, tonally versatile, highly playable, lightweight, produces sustain that runs for miles, has stunning good looks, and even comes with a hardshell case, what more could you possibly want?</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,536-536-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/dc0f583aad2971ab8effd11e7e420cd3.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson Les Paul Less Plus Electric Guitar - Fireburst,Gibson Les Paul Less Plus Electric Guitar - Fireburst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The 2017 model also features a newly designed fast-access heel, which removes any obstacles from your path to offer unparalleled access to the highest notes.</p><p>Married to the neck is a truly sublime rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with Mother-of-Pearl dot position inlays to guide your way in style. The 2017 model's fingerboard has been increased in thickness, which lends itself beautifully to the enhanced playing comfort that is aimed at making this the ideal neck for those who like to perform elaborate fretboard gymnastics.</p><h3> Improved G-FORCE auto-tuning </h3><p>Gibson has equipped the 2017 Explorer HP with an updated version of their G-FORCE auto-tuning system. This sits at the back of the headstock, and gives you access to alternate tunings and adjustment with greater speed and accuracy. The improved synchronized spur gear system operates smoothly and quietly, and boasts a highly impressive 40:01:00 gear ratio - you can rest assured that once your tuning is set, it will remain that way no matter how hard you rock out.</p><h3> High-gain hardware </h3><p>Fitted in the neck and bridge position respectively are the 496R and 500T, a pair of ceramic Gibson pickups that are quite frankly, high-gain beasts! The 496R is a high output pickup with an aggressive edge that cuts through the mix with a searing sustain. The 500T boasts an even higher output, with increased note definition and is absolutely perfect for dropping some weighty palm-muted chugging. Whether you're playing along to your favourite tracks at home, or blowing minds - and possibly a few ear drums - to an adoring crowd, these magnificent humbuckers will not disappoint.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of independent volume pots for each pickups, a master tone pot, and a silent, aviation-grade toggle switch for flawless pickup selection.</p><h3> Gig-ready setup </h3><p>Along with the G-FORCE tuning system, the Gibson 2017 Explorer HP has a titanium zero-fret adjustable nut, affording incredible tone, sustain and durability whilst allowing you to set string action with absolute precision. Fitted to the body is an aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with titanium saddles, which is partnered with an aluminium stopbar tailpiece with locking studs. The bridge/tailpiece combo creates a seamless connection between strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><p>Along with the classic Explorer headstock shape, body and neck profiles, and powerful output, Gibson have installed the iconic Explorer multi-ply pickguard. Each model is supplied with a specially designed Explorer hardshell case in brown, with plush interior to offer a stylish and protective companion. As well as a case, you will also receive a Gibson USA multi-tool, premium cloth, polishing cloth, and owner's manual.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,434-434-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/1fa27cca4f82120d75527137ce02e3df.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson 2017 Explorer HP Electric Guitar - Heritage Cherry,Gibson 2017 Explorer HP Electric Guitar - Heritage Cherry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Not only that, but the inclusion of modern improvements goes towards making the 2018 SG Standard a standout. Add a hardshell case and accessory kit and you've got yourself quite the package!</p><h3>Sublime solidbody SG</h3><p>The Gibson USA 2018 SG Standard is built and shaped to the classic slimline double-cutaway """"horns"""" profile we've all come to know and love. The unfussy yet undeniably cool design has often been imitated but never equalled. With gently bevelled edges and a balanced weight distribution, the 2018 SG is comfortable in the hands and a joy to wield. The body is crafted from mahogany, a tonewood that is favoured by Gibson due to its ability to generate masses of power infused with warmth. The finish is protected by a coating of gloss nitrocellulose lacquer that protects against unwanted blemishes detracting from the visual aesthetic.</p><h3>Fast playing neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a deftly crafted mahogany neck, which is shaped to the slimtaper profile for a lightning fast feel. Married to the neck is a luxurious rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 medium frets that have been cryogenically treated. The fingerboard is decorated with acrylic trapezoid position inlays, whilst white binding guarantees seamless transitions between every fret.</p><h3>'61 humbuckers</h3><p>To recreate classic '61 tone, the 2018 SG Standard is equipped with Gibson's 61R in the neck, and 61T in the bridge. Designed to produce a high-gain output, these humbuckers not only offer a sweet rendition of those early pickups, but also slide perfectly into modern day rock styles too. Control over the pickups comes in the form of a pair of volume pots, a pair of tone pots, and a three-way toggle switch to select either pickup independently or both simultaneously. In keeping with the vintage vibe, black 'Top Hat' knobs have been employed as the control pots.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The headstock is home to a bell-shaped chrome truss rod cover, whilst the distinctive Gibson logo resides between the locking kidney tuning machines. The tuners and Tektoid nut work dutifully to uphold tuning integrity and string tension. The body is home to the chrome finished aluminium Tune-O-Matic bridge, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar tailpiece, a combination that anchors each string securely to optimise intonation and sustain throughout the most emphatic of performances.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,600-600-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/ecbbe8cfa5a58a5287500527435d4c89.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson USA 2018 SG Standard Electric Guitar - Autumn Shade,Gibson USA 2018 SG Standard Electric Guitar - Autumn Shade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Whether you're recording tracks in the studio or hitting the stage, the EB Bass 5 String T Bass allows you to get the job done in style.</p><h3> Sophisticated EB profile </h3><p>The body has been crafted using Swamp ash, which is a tonewood that is highly regarded by luthiers thanks to its richness of tone and girthy midrange energy.

The body protected by a smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer, which preserves that natural grain and paintwork to allow your Les Paul to age gracefully. The 2018 Les Paul Classic also bypasses any weight relief system so you get the full rock-solid power and tone of the original.</p><h3>Single-piece mahogany neck</h3><p>To create a confident playing feel, Gibson have fitted a single-piece mahogany neck using a solid mortise and tenon joint reinforced using Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive. You can rest assured that no matter how hard you play, the neck is built with durability at its heart. Thanks to its slimtaper profile, the neck is delightfully slender and accommodating most player's hands with ease.</p><p>Married to the neck is a rosewood fingerboard, which plays home to 22 frets that are adorned with trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. Cream binding along the fingerboard ensures seamless transitions between frets, whilst the standard 12-inch radius makes it a breeze to perform smooth string bends.</p><h3>P90 vintage tone</h3><p>To create a tonal match for the sophisticated '60s/'70s aesthetic, the Gibson 2018 Les Paul Classic Electric Guitar is equipped with a pair of P90 single coil pickups to give it the depth and warmth it deserves. The crispness of the maple rings truly, offering a snappy juxtaposition to the warm, dense mahogany.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes via the pickup independent volume and tone controls, which allow you to sculpt and shape your tone with precision. Orange Drop capacitors ensure that the slightest of adjustments is executed as smoothly as possible, putting absolute tone control in your hands.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>The headstock is home to Grover's kidney style locking tuners with an impressive tuning ratio, so you can rest assured that no slipping will occur during any emphatic string bending. The strings meet the body via the ABR bridge and aluminium stop bar tailpiece. From the tuning machines down to the tailpiece, everything is designed and fitted to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>Each Gibson USA 2018 Les Paul Classic Electric Guitar model is supplied with a classic Gibson hardshell case in brown to protect your pride and joy and an accessory kit so that you can protect and enjoy this exquisite guitar as soon as you get it home.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,562-562-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/b506294f8d4797d96f3f3cf9c09bb1ea.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson USA 2018 Les Paul Classic Electric Guitar,Gibson USA 2018 Les Paul Classic Electric Guitar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Maintaining that distinct, traditional double cutaway body with some new, updated appointments to go with it, the 2017 SG Special HP is truly built for incredible, high performance as its title suggests.</p><h3>BODY</h3><p>The SG Special has a body constructed from mahogany, a predominant choice of tonewood in Gibson's history due to its beautiful tone delivery. The double cutaway body has been given a satin-nitrocellulose finish for that tidy appearance. Gibson have also equipped the SG Special HP with a sculpted fast access heel for exceptional, easy reach to every fret.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>The 2017 SG Special HP is fitted with a smooth, Soloist mahogany neck that is shaped to the very favourable Slim Taper profile. The Soloist neck width allows a much faster playing feel with more room, so shredding riffs is easier than ever.</p><p>The neck is topped with a 12 inch radius rosewood fingerboard, providing the most sumptuous playing surface beneath the fingertips. Decorating the frets for a traditional look are small Mother of Pearl block inlays to guide you. For total control over the string action and for better sustain there is a titanium zero-fret adjustable nut.</p><h3>HUMBUCKER PICKUPS</h3><p>For a modern, accurate take on vintage PAF-style Gibson tone, the SG Special HP is fitted with a pair of humbucker pickups. A 490R is fitted in the neck position joined by a 498T in the bridge position. This pickup duo provide a great range of tonal depth, just as you would expect from Gibson humbuckers. Each pickup works to prevent unwanted interference or hum.</p><p>Despite having some new, updated features, the 2017 SG Special HP still has four main control pots for rhythm and lead Volume and Tone, plus the usual 3-way toggle pickup switch to shape your sound.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The headstock may look traditional with the chrome bell-shaped truss rod cover, Gibson logo and crown, however it has been fitted with the updated G-FORCE tuners. The G-FORCE tuners provide a much faster way of retuning your strings and with great precision, too. Gibson have also ensured that the tuning gears have been quietened to avoid unwanted noise.</p><p>The body is fitted with a traditional chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with titanium saddles and an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece with locking studs for quality sustain and resonance.</p><p>The SG style pickguard protects the body, keeping the finish looking neat. To help the owner keep this guitar in the best possible condition for years to come, Gibson include a padded HP gigbag, guitar strap and polishing cloth.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,472-472-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/392e0075e3dcc143400d5bbc0b83f1ec.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson 2017 SG Special HP Electric Guitar - Satin Vintage Sunburst,Gibson 2017 SG Special HP Electric Guitar - Satin Vintage Sunburst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The result is a rendition of the famous """"Workhorse"""" that offers enhanced playing comfort whilst retaining the same vigorous energy and resilience.</p><h3>Dreadnought power</h3><p>The Gibson J-45 is highly respected the world over thanks to its impressive dynamic range, hardy build quality, and rich acoustic timbre. The 2018 J-45 Avant Garde back and sides are crafted using walnut, a hardwood that produces a warm midrange timbre whilst establishing a reassuringly robust feel. The top is built using Sitka spruce, a tonewood that is favoured in soundboard construction thanks to its excellent ability to resonate and project tones with confidence. The top is reinforced using traditional hand-scalloped X-bracing, allowing to resonate unimpeded whilst preventing buckling or warping over time.</p><h3>Sturdy neck design</h3><p>Married to the body via a compound dovetail joint is a supple two-piece maple neck, which has been shaped to the advanced response profile for a slimmer feel in the hand. Married to the neck is a luxurious walnut fingerboard, which is home to 20 frets that are adorned with mother of pearl dot position inlays to provide a lavish navigational aid. The fingerboard is polished with finishing oil to enhance the natural compounds of the wood, thus giving it a lasting feel of elegance.</p><h3>Gig-ready appointments</h3><p>The headstock is home to Mini Grover tuners, which uphold tuning integrity with precision. The body is home to the rounded rectangle walnut bridge, which creates a seamless connection between the strings and body for optimised intonation and sustain. The result is a guitar that performs with consistency every time you pick up and play. Whether you're recording in the studio or taking to the stage, knowing that you can rely on your instrument is of the utmost importance. You can put all your trust in the J-45.</p><h3> L.R. Baggs Element VTC Pickup System </h3><p>Equipped with the award-winning L.R. Baggs Element VTC electronics' system, you can take to the stage in effortless style and plug directly into the amp or P.A. of your choosing, safe in the knowledge that the acoustic character of your guitar will be translated transparently.</p><p>The pre-attached Element pickup, and all-discrete endpin preamp are controlled using the soundhole-mounted volume and tone controls. The built-in low frequency crossover prevents any unwanted low-end grunt from over-powering your signal, and allows the natural timbre of the J-45 to sing with the utmost clarity.</p><p>The Gibson Acoustic 2018 J-45 Avant Garde Acoustic Guitar in Walnut Burst is supplied with a Gibson hardshell case, as well as a Gibson accessory kit. Wherever your music takes you, you can get your guitar there in security and style, and keep it in top condition for years to come.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,500-500-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/80d8cdd5212d9366e849e68ef0795adc.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson Acoustic 2018 J-45 Avant Garde Acoustic Guitar - Walnut Burst,Gibson Acoustic 2018 J-45 Avant Garde Acoustic Guitar - Walnut Burst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Alongside vintage-style features resides modern appointments that make this model a truly outstanding work of craftsmanship. It doesn't get much closer to the original than the 2018 Les Paul Traditional. Accompanying the guitar is a Gibson hardshell case and accessory kit.</p><h3> Late '50s Les Paul design </h3><p>To uphold the substantial feel of the late '50s Les Paul, Gibson have kept this as a non-weight relieved model. The result is a substantial yet manageable feel in the hands, with an unbeatable sustain and warmth. The same single-cutaway profile that we've all come to know and love is present and correct.</p><p>The classic tonewood partnership of mahogany body with maple top has been retained too. However, this isn't any old maple, it is grade AA figured maple. The result is a weighty midrange foundation with a clean upper mid to high frequency articulation that shines through. From smooth blues licks to searing high-gain soloing, the heart of the Les Paul produces resounding tones to suit any musical style. The finish has been treated to a slender yet durable layer of gloss nitrocellulose lacquer to protect against premature wear.</p><h3> Classic rounded neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid mahogany neck, which has been shaped to the rounded profile - again, ensuring a substantial yet manageable feel in the hand. Married to the neck is a sublime 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with acrylic trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. Rolled-over-fret cream binding creates seamless transitions between each fret to create the smoothest feel possible.</p><h3> Resilient, stage-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck you'll find the Tektoid nut, which works tirelessly to maintain string tension. The headstock is angled to Gibson's customary 17-degrees to improve tuning stability, whilst the Gibson logo is proudly on display for all to see. The nickel-plated vintage-style keystone tuning machines boast an impressive gear ratio, allowing them to firmly secure your strings during each and every performance. The body is home to the ABR bridge, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar tailpiece to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3>Sublime BurstBucker pickups</h3><p>The Gibson 2018 Les Paul Traditional is equipped with Burstbucker 1 and 2 humbuckers, fitted in the neck and bridge positions respectively. The Alnico II-powered Burstbuckers translate the richness of the body tonewoods, and the articulation of the neck and fingerboard construction with impeccable clarity. Control over the pickups comes in the form of classic gold Top Hat knobs, which complement the stunning finish beautifully.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,579-579-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/103dddd577765b1bae4a5da7e92ce6f4.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson USA 2018 Les Paul Traditional Electric Guitar,Gibson USA 2018 Les Paul Traditional Electric Guitar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Through a combination of vintage-style and updated technology, Gibson has captured the vibrant energy and character of a classic Les Paul, whilst exceeding the tonal demands of today's guitarists.</p><h3>Sleek Les Paul design</h3><p>As you'd expect, the body is crafted using classic combination of two-piece mahogany that has been combined with a grade A plain maple top. The mahogany has been treated to a 9-hole weight relief rout, which makes the body lighter and easier to wield, without losing any of that raw Les Paul power. The maple doesn't just look pretty either; it lends itself to a sweetly delivered high-end that allows this beauty to truly sparkle. The body protected by a smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer, which preserves that natural grain and paintwork to allow your Les Paul to age gracefully.</p><h3>Single-piece mahogany neck</h3><p>To create a confident playing feel, Gibson have fitted a single-piece mahogany neck using a solid mortise and tenon joint reinforced using Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive. You can rest assured that no matter how hard you play, the neck is built with durability at its heart. Thanks to its slimtaper profile, the neck is delightfully slender and accommodating most player's hands with ease.</p><p>Married to the neck is a heavenly rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. Cream binding along the fingerboard ensures seamless transitions between frets, whilst the standard 12-inch radius makes it a breeze to perform smooth string bends.</p><h3>Zebra '57 Classic humbuckers</h3><p>To create a tonal match for the sophisticated '60s/'70s aesthetic, the Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar is equipped with a Zebra '57 Classic in the neck position, and a Zebra '57 Classic Plus in the bridge. The depth and warmth of the mahogany is given the commanding presence it deserves, with a hearty mid to low-end energy flowing from the pickups, thanks to the wound Alnico II magnet-driven humbuckers. The crispness of the maple rings truly, offering a snappy counterpoint to the dense mahogany.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes via the pickup independent volume and tone controls, which allow you to sculpt and shape your tone with precision. Orange Drop capacitors ensure that the slightest of adjustments is executed as smoothly as possible, putting absolute tone control in your hands.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>The headstock is home to Grover's zamak locking tuners with an impressive 14:01 tuning ratio, so you can rest assured that no slipping will occur during any emphatic string bending. The strings meet the body via the nickel-plated zamak ABR bridge and nickel-plated aluminium stop bar tailpiece. From the tuning machines down to the tailpiece, everything is designed and fitted to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>Each Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar model is supplied with a classic Gibson hardshell case in brown to protect your pride and joy whether it is in storage or in transit. With the 2017 model you will also receive a Gibson USA multi tool, premium strap, polishing cloth, and owner's manual to help you to keep your Les Paul in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,442-442-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/1da3bd001773e490cc36774b18e2ae0d.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Guitar - Heritage Cherry Sunburst,Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Guitar - Heritage Cherry Sunburst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Now the guys at Gibson Custom have brought it back with historically accurate appointments to give you a reincarnation that is as close to the original as possible. This was one of the first Gibson sunburst models which has since become legendary and this new version brings it right up to date.</p><h3>MAPLE AND MAHOGANY</h3><p>In 1958 when Gibson first designed the original Les Paul Standard guitars, they would all feature a two-piece maple body top, and the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard indeed has a two-piece figured maple top. Figured maple is instantly eye-catching due to its flame-like texture while it also contributes to producing that vintage, '58 sound of the original.</p><p>The top is accompanied by mahogany in the back and sides which makes for the perfect partnership with the figured maple top to produce a strong, resonant output as authentic as those models which were first released in the late 50s. This version is given the 1950s style Les Paul body contour with no weight relief for a historically correct feel.</p><h3>VINTAGE CORRECT NECK</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard is fitted with a single-piece mahogany neck with a comfortable 1950's style Les Paul profile. It is firmly joined to the body using hot hide-glue which was a constitutional element of the original guitars. The neck also has a historic long-tenon neck joint which enables the guitar to precisely convey its classic tone.</p><p>Aboard the neck is a solid, one-piece Indian rosewood fingerboard which assists the mahogany in providing an all-round Les Paul sound. With 22 frets at your service, you can work your way up and down the neck in confidence thanks to the cellulose Trapezoid inlays.</p><h3>CUSTOM BUCKER PICKUPS</h3><p>Gibson have employed Custom Bucker pickups in the electronics of the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard, and consider them to be their best replica of PAF pickups yet. The Custom Buckers achieve an output that is as close to the original sound of a '58 guitar as you can imagine. Each pickup is powered by Alnico III magnets which deliver you a mix of epic ringing or deep rumble depending on the sound output that you require.</p><p>To help you control the rhythm and lead pickups, the guitar is fitted with two Volume and two Tone pots with matched 500k potentiometers and encased with gold top hats.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard has an ABR bridge with thumbwheels partnered with a lightweight aluminium stop bar tailpiece which enhances the overall intonation and sustain. At the top end of the guitar at the headstock we have reissue Kluson deluxe green keys made with nickel plated steel to uphold tuning integrity with accuracy.</p><p>Protecting the beautiful, hand-sprayed nitrocellulose finish on the body is a 1950's style cream pickguard which also really complements the guitar. The guitar also comes equipped with a reissue Les Paul case with a brown outer and pink fur lining to further protect this wonderful guitar.</p><p>It is without doubt that the new range of Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard guitars are as authentic as you could wish for in sound, feel and appearance.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,550-550-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/ea5bbbe65bcf934eab82e61fd75ef913.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul - Washed Cherry VOS,Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul - Washed Cherry VOS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The 496R is a high output pickup with an aggressive edge that cuts through the mix with a searing sustain. The 500T boasts an even higher output, with increased note definition and is absolutely perfect for dropping some weighty palm-muted chugging. Whether you're playing along to your favourite tracks at home, or blowing minds - and possibly a few ear drums - to an adoring crowd, these magnificent humbuckers will not disappoint.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of independent volume pots for each pickups, a master tone pot, and a silent, aviation-grade toggle switch for flawless pickup selection.</p><h3> Gig-ready setup </h3><p>Along with the G-FORCE tuning system, the Gibson 2017 Explorer HP has a titanium zero-fret adjustable nut, affording incredible tone, sustain and durability whilst allowing you to set string action with absolute precision.

With select tonewoods, versatile electronics, and robust hardware at your disposal, Jackson have once again thought of everything to ensure the Kelly JS32 is an exceptional model for its price.</p><h3> Slick Kelly body </h3><p>Since it burst onto the scene in the early '80s, the Kelly has been the weapon of choice for many hard rockers and metallers. Thanks to its balanced and lightweight feel, superb playability, and not least its unabashed style, it quickly became an instant classic. The JS32 series Kelly adheres to those same principles, employing poplar as the body tonewood to guarantee a lightweight feel that makes it a joy to perform with. Finished with a cool snow white paint job, the body is protected by a layer of gloss to prevent unwanted scratches and blemishes.</p><h3> Reinforced neck design </h3><p>Jackson appreciate that the Kelly is a guitar that is built for the stage, and is going to be shown off. With that in mind, they also appreciate that humidity and temperature changes can have a devastating effect on a guitar's neck. Therefore, they have reinforced the bolt-on single-piece maple neck using graphite, which prevents unwanted twisting and warping over time. You can rest assured that where you take your guitar, it will be ready to rock every time. Thanks to a satin finish, your hand can glide along the neck with ease, free from unwanted stickiness or tackiness from impeding your movement.</p><p>Partnered with the neck is a dark rosewood fingerboard, which has 24 jumbo frets that are decorated with pearloid sharkfin position inlays. Jackson's customary compound radius fingerboard creates a natural feel for the fingers as they navigate the playing surface. Paired with the speed neck profile, you can rest assured that every effort has been made to establish a lightning fast playing feel.</p><h3> Jackson high output humbuckers </h3><p>The Jackson JS Series Kelly JS32 is equipped with a pair of their high output humbuckers, which generate a punchy and defiant output that puts a wide range of tones at the ready. Everything from crisp cleans that could cut through glass to headbanger-worthy aggressive chunk is present and correct. Control over the pickups comes in the form of a master volume pot, a mater tone pot, and a three-way pickups selector switch to keep everything simple yet effective.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>The body is fitted with a Floyd Rose Licensed Jackson double locking tremolo bridge, which lays the foundation for pinpoint accurate vibrato control. The Floyd Rose R3 locking nut anchors each string so that no matter how much you dive and wail with the bridge, your strings remain firmly intact and ready for action. The feel of the bridge is highly responsive, giving you complete mastery over your vibrato.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Jackson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,894-894-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/275d877c58e4657b2daf02ed6facbf7c.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Jackson JS Series Kelly JS32 Electric Guitar - Snow White,Jackson JS Series Kelly JS32 Electric Guitar - Snow White,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Released at the 1987 Chicago NAMM Show, the Steve Vai-designed JEM marked a major turning point in the history of Ibanez, and the development of the electric guitar. Becoming an icon to rival other models, the JEM has gone on to spawn the ever-popular RG series, which is only second to another legendary model. Staking its place in musical history, the Ibanez JEM777 is a heavenly guitar that fortunately us mere mortals can play, and with this very special 30th Anniversary model, we are truly spoilt. </p> <h3> Unique JEM body design</h3> <p> The body is shaped to the same ergonomically designed profile as the original. With gentle bevelled edges and curves in all the right places, this is a model that sits as sweetly during performances for maximum playing comfort. Vai was perplexed by the way other models impeded access to the upper frets, hence the deep double-cutaway that opens the fretboard in its entirety for you to explore. </p> <p> The body is crafted from basswood, a medium-weight tonewood that boasts a well-defined midrange energy with subtle low-end power. The highs like to sizzle before never overpower the timbre, and are never harsh on the ears. Each note is given the space it deserves, ensuring an articulate output across the frequency spectrum. The body is equipped with a pickguard to protect areas around the control knobs and the underside of the strings. Finally, we can't forget the distinctive Vai-designed 'monkey grip' located above the strings, which allows you to carry the guitar easily. </p> <h3> Lightning fast JEM 5-piece maple/walnut neck </h3> <p> The neck is shaped to the lightning fast JEM profile. Crafted from a 5-piece combination of maple and walnut, this is a virtuoso's dream, thanks to the razor thin dimensions that allow your finger to soar. If you're looking for a dream neck to play heavenly sweeps on, then this is the neck for you. </p> <p> A luxurious maple fingerboard is married to the neck, adorned with the truly unique disappearing pyramid inlay, guiding your way in beautiful style. The inclusion of 6105 frets guarantee exceptionally smooth string bends, whilst the Prestige fret edge treatment promises seamless transitions between frets. Not only that but delicate scalloping between the 21st and 24th frets gives unrivalled control and ease of access to the upper frets. </p> <h3> DiMarzio Evolution pickups </h3> <p> To cover the versatile range of tones that Vai is known for producing, DiMarzio Evolution pickups are utilised in the neck, middle and bridge positions. The neck and bridge pickups are passive/ceramic humbuckers and the middle pickup is a passive/alnico single-coil. The 5-way selector switch allows you to pull a wide array of tones from this pickup compliment - from gentle soft-rock tones, tight and clean jazz lick, dense hard rock and ear-piercing metal. Simply put, if you're a session player or a guitarist who likes to mix it up, the Evos have got you covered! </p> <h3> Life-changing Lion's Claw </h3> <p> The JEM777 was designed with the unique Lion's Claw tremolo cavity, which allowed the Edge tremolo to wail as well as dive, lending itself perfectly to Vai's enigmatic playing style. Thanks to the tuning machine, locking nut, and Edge bridge partnership, once you are tuned up and locked in, you can rest assured that tuning integrity, intonation and sustain will remain faithful throughout the most energetic of performances. </p> <p> For protection on the go, a specially designed hardshell case is included to protect your pride and joy from unwanted bumps and scrapes. The Ibanez JEM777 30th Anniversary Edition Electric Guitar is supplied with Certificate of Authenticity (Tour Pass), whilst a JEM 30th Anniversary logo neck plate adds an extra special finishing touch. </p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Ibanez Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,768-768-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/8718ed8147546870494a611e3f0cec7d.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Ibanez JEM777 30th Anniversary Edition Electric Guitar,Ibanez JEM777 30th Anniversary Edition Electric Guitar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Equipped with a powerful trio of U.S.-made DiMarzio pickups, it is as versatile as it is beautiful. </p> <p> Since its release over 30 years ago, the RG body shape has been a favourite amongst metallers, shredders, and virtuosos, who need an instrument that feels solid and reassuring, yet lightweight and free. </p> <p> The body is crafted from basswood, a tonally neutral wood that allows the pickups to soar, and delivers a robust sustain that ensures your tone will gallop. Finished in a sophisticated White Pearl Metallic paintjob, the RG2550Z is perfect for stealing the limelight on stage. </p> <h3> Neck </h3> <p> As with all Ibanez guitars, the neck has been crafted with delicate care and precision to ensure it is as smooth, fast and easy to play as possible. The 5-piece maple/walnut neck is tonally bright - complementing the rich lower tones produced by the body -, with articulation infused into each and every note across the luxurious rosewood fingerboard. The extra-long scale Wizard HP neck profile ensures an enduring sustain, as well as a super slim playing platform to elegantly perform fretboard gymnastics on. The RG2550Z benefits from the Prestige Fret-Edge Treatment, guaranteeing smooth transitions along the neck as you play. </p> <h3> Electronics </h3> <p> In order to deliver the greatest breadth of tonal diversity, Ibanez has fitted this Prestige model with three outstanding US-made DiMarzio pickups. In the neck position is the Air Norton passive humbucker, in the middle is a True Velvet passive single-coil, and in the bridge is The Tone Zone passive humbucker. This trio equips you with everything you need to perform subtle clean licks to taking to the heavens. </p> <p> Control over the pickups comes in the form of a 5-way pickup selector switch to access each pickup individually, or combining the inner coil of the neck or bridge pickup with the middle. The master volume and master tone controls do the rest, so all you need to do is rock out. </p> <h3> Hardware </h3> <p> The Edge-Zero tremolo bridge with Zero Point System 3, allows you to dive-bomb and wail to your heart's content. No matter how aggressive or frenetic your style, the highly responsive trem system will ensure that your strings retain their tuning without any fuss. Minor adjustments can be made on the fly and the tension of the whammy bar can be modified to suit your playing style.

Introduced in 2006, and built using the Grand Symphony body shape, this guitar delivers a rich, powerful acoustic voice. Offering a richly textured and full-bodied sound, which is responsive to the lightest of touches, the body offers an outstanding dynamic range. Whether you prefer to attack the strings with a fast picking or strumming style, or prefer to play with a deft fingerstyle technique, the Taylor 356ce delivers a beautifully lush tone.</p><p>Taylor twelve-strings employ reinforced braces in comparison to 6-strings to account for the increased string tension and to prevent the top from buckling. This means the Taylor 356ce features a thicker top piece, denser pin plates, and heavier, non-scalloped bracing, in order to support the top and adequately amplify the tone of the guitar.</p><p>The back and side wood of the 356ce is built using West African Sapele wood, which has been utilised by Taylor for over a decade. Sapele is known for having similar harmonic qualities to mahogany in delivering soothing lows and warm mid tones. It is a very-adaptable tonewood that allows a variety of styles from fingerstyle to strumming to really shine.</p><p>The top wood is built using Sitka Spruce which as Taylor say,</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Taylor Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,1065-1065-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/f256a6e344c96ca51a407c192f28324f.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Taylor 356CE 12-String Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,Taylor 356CE 12-String Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Drawing on a wealth of experience gained over their 130-year history, Gretsch has crafted the Bobtail to their customary high standard of quality, delivering an exceptional model that exceeds the expectations of today's musicians. The beautiful natural finish combined with the modest design of the metal cone not only looks wonderful, but also produces rich and powerful tones.</p><p>To give the body of the G9220 a rugged and reliable feel, laminated mahogany has been tasked with the job of generating a generous stirring mid to low-end warmth. As the mahogany is laminated, this gives the wood fantastic resilience in handling changes in temperature and humidity, making it perfect for globetrotting musicians. The top has been given a subtle 2-colour sunburst finish, complete with """"F"""" holes to accentuate the top's projection. Into the body sits the all-new Gretsch """"Ampli-Sonic"""" diaphragm (resonator cone), which is hand-spun in Eastern Europe from nearly 99-percent pure aluminium, allowing it to yield an impressive sonic quality with a wide dynamic range.</p><p>Fitted to the body is the sturdy mahogany neck, which has been shaped to a classic medium """"V"""" profile. The neck has been finished in semi-gloss vintage sunburst. Married to the neck is a sumptuous rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 19 medium-jumbo frets that are adorned with pearloid dot position inlays to aid in your navigation.</p><p>For those wishing to take their Bobtail to the stage or want to plug in and play, the G9220 is equipped with a Fishman Nashville Series Resophonic pickup, perfectly suited to delivering the timbre of the resonator with the utmost transparency.</p><p>The 1930's Gretsch headstock with aged pearloid face carries the Grover Sta-Tite die-cast tuning machines uphold tuning integrity with absolute precision. The bone nut maintains string tension for a consistent playing feel - important when performing slide.</p><p>Whether you're an amateur or a touring pro, if you've coveted the classic resonator tone's associated with players like Son House, or styles such as blues, bluegrass and country of the 1920s/30s, then the Gretsch G9220 Bobtail round-neck resonator takes you closer than ever to reaching tonal nirvana.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gretsch Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,659-659-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/93c87fe60d1b95f3de6f368d547ab0eb.jpeg,1,,FALSE,G9220 Bobtail Round Neck Resonator Guitar,G9220 Bobtail Round Neck Resonator Guitar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Though it has long been associated with hard rock and metal, it is a much more versatile instrument that is well suited to a wide range of other styles from jazz to blues, prog and grunge. The 2017 HP (High Performance) model is endowed with a selection of premium appointments that makes this the perfect choice for professionals who want a powerful workhorse that is built for life on the road.</p><h3>The Flying V</h3><p>Just looking at the Flying V, it becomes immediately clear as to where its name comes from. Multi-cut mahogany has been employed as the body tonewood, giving the V a commanding mid to low-end energy. Though it comes in at under 4lbs, the guitar produces an enduring sustain. As with other models in the 2017 range, Gibson has increased the comfortability of the guitar by including a sculpted fast-access heel. This accompanies a flat carve body contour and makes it even more enjoyable to wield.</p><h3>Slimtaper Flying V profile</h3><p>Securely fitted to the V-shape body - via a traditional Mortis and Tenon joint with Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive reinforcement - is a single-piece mahogany neck. Shaped to the Flying V slimtaper profile, Gibson have designed this neck with soloists in mind to be a fast and smooth playing dream. Married to the neck is a 22-fret grenadillo fingerboard, which is decorated with Mother-of-Pearl dot inlays to conduct your way up and down the frets with confidence.</p><p>At the top of the neck is an innovative titanium zero-fret adjustable nut, which couples exceptional sustain with outstanding resonance for a rich, full-bodied tone. The zero-fret nut also gives the neck and strings the fastest action to date, perfect for rock guitarists who play at break-neck speeds.</p><h3>Dirty Finger+ pickups</h3><p>The Dirty Fingers+ humbuckers are Ceramic magnet-powered high gain monsters that deliver searing tones to die for. These beauties are perfect for taking centre stage, with a loud and aggressive edge that pushes amps hard - making them a fantastic partner for your tube/valve amp. Beefing up the sustain generated by the body/neck combo, the Dirty Fingers+ sing with absolute clarity.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of newly designed knurled knobs, with added grip to ensure greater precision when making tonal adjustments during energetic sets.</p><h3> Improved G-FORCE auto-tuning </h3><p>Gibson has equipped the 2017 Flying V HP with an updated version of their G-FORCE auto-tuning system. This sits at the back of the headstock, and gives you access to alternate tunings and adjustment with greater speed and accuracy. The improved synchronized spur gear system operates smoothly and quietly, and boasts a highly impressive 40:01 gear ratio - you can rest assured that once your tuning is set, it will remain that way no matter how hard you rock out.</p><h3>Stage-ready hardware</h3><p>The Gibson 2017 Flying V HP is fitted with a chrome-plated Tune-o-Matic bridge with titanium saddles and locking thumbwheels, which is paired with a chrome-plated aluminium stopbar tailpiece with locking studs. The titanium saddles further enhance the sustain and helps to produce a crystal clear, bright sound.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>Each Gibson 2017 Flying V HP Electric Guitar model is supplied with a hardshell case in aluminium to protect your pride and joy whether it is in storage or in transit. With the 2017 model you will also receive a Gibson USA multi tool, premium strap, polishing cloth, and owner's manual to help you to keep your Flying V in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,440-440-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/6b777de46c7228faba13abcb9cc3bb74.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson 2017 Flying V HP Electric Guitar - Ebony,Gibson 2017 Flying V HP Electric Guitar - Ebony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Everything about this model screams excellence, and to play one will have you craving the limelight - so it is a good job that each model is supplied with an aluminium travel case and accessory kit.</p><h3>Sublime solidbody</h3><p>The 2018 SG Standard HP raises the bar for SGs in terms of build quality. The body is crafted using mahogany, which establishes a solid midrange tonal foundation. Paired with the body is a visually commanding AA figured maple top, which sets off the spectacular visual aesthetic beautifully. The deep double-cutaway """"horns"""" are present and correct, with sweetly bevelled edges complementing the slimline design to create the unbelievably comfortable playing feel that has drawn so many players to the SG.</p><h3>Fast playing neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a meticulously crafted neck, which is shaped to the slimtaper profile that is paired with the soloist neck width for the perfect balance of speed and accuracy. For unrestricted control over string action and better sustain there is a titanium adjustable nut with locking feature. As ever, the SG rewards fearless players and those who like to rock out in style. Married to the neck is a luxurious rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 24 low profile frets that have been cryogenically treated. The fingerboard is adorned with pearl trapezoid position inlays to guide you along its entire length.</p><h3>'57 Classic humbuckers</h3><p>Gibson have employed a pair of classic humbucker pickups in the 2018 SG Standard HP, with a '57 Classic in the neck position and a Super '57 Classic in the bridge position. The '57 Classic humbuckers are designed to accurately replicate the original PAF-style tone heard on the original SG models.</p><p>However, the modern-day twist on the electronics setup makes the Standard HP a highly adaptable model, expanding the tonal versatility of the SG further than before. The volume pots have push-pull switches to coil tap each pickup, whilst the DIP switch enables a range of tones to be plucked from the humbuckers. Whatever style of music you play, this guitar can traverse any musical landscape with ease.</p><h3>Improved G-FORCE tuning system</h3><p>Gibson's G-FORCE auto-tuning system has also been given an upgrade, so that fast, accurate string tuning is now even easier than ever before. Whether you're playing in standard, using an alternate tuning, or making up your own that you can save and recall at a later time, you'll be amazed at how smoothly the G-FORCE system operates.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The headstock is home to a bell-shaped chrome truss rod cover, whilst the distinctive Gibson logo resides between the tuning machines. The body is home to the chrome finished aluminium Tune-O-Matic bridge with titanium saddles, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar tailpiece. Everything has been designed and fitted to contribute to the SG Standard HP's superb sustain.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,593-593-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/5b462ca64168f4f368d9963514caeca7.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson USA 2018 SG Standard HP Electric Guitar - Cobalt Fade,Gibson USA 2018 SG Standard HP Electric Guitar - Cobalt Fade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Now the guys at Gibson Custom have brought it back with historically accurate appointments to give you a reincarnation that is as close to the original as possible. This was one of the first Gibson sunburst models which has since become legendary and this new version brings it right up to date.</p><h3>MAPLE AND MAHOGANY</h3><p>In 1958 when Gibson first designed the original Les Paul Standard guitars, they would all feature a two-piece maple body top, and the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard indeed has a two-piece figured maple top. Figured maple is instantly eye-catching due to its flame-like texture while it also contributes to producing that vintage, '58 sound of the original.</p><p>The top is accompanied by mahogany in the back and sides which makes for the perfect partnership with the figured maple top to produce a strong, resonant output as authentic as those models which were first released in the late 50s. This version is given the 1950s style Les Paul body contour with no weight relief for a historically correct feel.</p><h3>VINTAGE CORRECT NECK</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard is fitted with a single-piece mahogany neck with a comfortable 1950's style Les Paul profile. It is firmly joined to the body using hot hide-glue which was a constitutional element of the original guitars. The neck also has a historic long-tenon neck joint which enables the guitar to precisely convey its classic tone.</p><p>Aboard the neck is a solid, one-piece Indian rosewood fingerboard which assists the mahogany in providing an all-round Les Paul sound. With 22 frets at your service, you can work your way up and down the neck in confidence thanks to the cellulose Trapezoid inlays.</p><h3>CUSTOM BUCKER PICKUPS</h3><p>Gibson have employed Custom Bucker pickups in the electronics of the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard, and consider them to be their best replica of PAF pickups yet. The Custom Buckers achieve an output that is as close to the original sound of a '58 guitar as you can imagine. Each pickup is powered by Alnico III magnets which deliver you a mix of epic ringing or deep rumble depending on the sound output that you require.</p><p>To help you control the rhythm and lead pickups, the guitar is fitted with two Volume and two Tone pots with matched 500k potentiometers and encased with gold top hats.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard has an ABR bridge with thumbwheels partnered with a lightweight aluminium stop bar tailpiece which enhances the overall intonation and sustain. At the top end of the guitar at the headstock we have reissue Kluson deluxe green keys made with nickel plated steel to uphold tuning integrity with accuracy.</p><p>Protecting the beautiful, hand-sprayed nitrocellulose finish on the body is a 1950's style cream pickguard which also really complements the guitar. The guitar also comes equipped with a reissue Les Paul case with a brown outer and pink fur lining to further protect this wonderful guitar.</p><p>It is without doubt that the new range of Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard guitars are as authentic as you could wish for in sound, feel and appearance.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,541-541-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/4a5ad737e3d8d174bbc22f14c3f902ac.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul - Faded Tobacco VOS,Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul - Faded Tobacco VOS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The body still has its classic shape, however it is lighter than ever. Gibson luthiers have employed a new Ultra-Modern weight relief technique in the mahogany body which improves tone and boosts playing comfort, thus reducing fatigue onstage.</p><p>The mahogany body is joined by an A-grade plain maple top, hand-picked by the expert luthiers at Gibson to provide better, truer Gibson tones. A coat of protective Hi-Gloss Lacquer / 90 Sheen finishes the body top for a stunning visual aesthetic.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>Using the traditional Mortis and Tenon joint and reliable, time-tested Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive, Gibson have joined a smooth mahogany neck. The neck has a more comfortable Slim Taper profile which enhances and promotes a faster playing style.</p><p>Topping the neck is a thicker rosewood fingerboard with a 12 inch radius and 22 frets to explore. The thickness of the rosewood is a contributor to the tonal depth on offer from this stunning 2017 model. Frets feature the traditional trapezoid inlays to guide you. A Tektoid nut that is self-lubricating has also been fitted for a better return to pitch and improved sustain.</p><h3>ELECTRONICS</h3><p>The 2017 Les Paul Studio T has been equipped with a pair of superb humbucker pickups; a 490R pickup in the neck position powered by an Alnico II magnet, and a 498T pickup powered by an Alnico V magnet in the bridge position. Each pickup has been crafted to replicate authentic PAF-style Gibson tones, while they also work relentlessly to cancel out any unwanted noise or interference for a much cleaner output.</p><p>The Les Paul Studio T features four control pots for rhythm and lead Volume and Tone, including two push/pull controls for independent coil tapping.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>For unrivalled sustain and resonance, the body is fitted with a chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge accompanied by an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece, the most modern bridge/tailpiece combination that there is.</p><p>The headstock is fitted with Grover Kidney chrome-plated tuning keys set to an accurate 18:01 gear ratio.</p><p>A protective Les Paul pickguard preserves the body top against scratches, while also complementing the finish of the guitar.

The sturdy workmanship comes as no surprise, the team at Gretsch know a thing or two about crafting road-ready models that keep up with the most demanding of performers. The stylish vintage finishes are matched by perfectly appointed modern touches that combine to create a heavenly instrument. If you're a left-handed rock 'n' roller, then it doesn't get much better than the G5420LH.</p><h3> Bound single-cutaway body </h3><p>Gretsch have shaped the G5420LH to a thinline hollow body design, which is built to create the perfect marriage of comfortability and tonal versatility. By using 5-ply maple as the body tonewood, the guitar is afforded a confident midrange character that has a gently rounded bottom-end, and sings across the highs with a sparkling clarity.</p><p>The body top is decorated with stylish over-sized bound f-holes that allows the acoustic timbre to project forth gracefully. The body is bound to create a stylish transition between the top and side woods. The paintwork has been treated to a slender yet resilient coating of gloss to preserving it for as long as possible. The body is completed by the application of a silver plexi pickguard, which proudly displays a black Gretsch logo.</p><h3> Gloss-finished maple neck </h3><p>Paired with the body is a gloss-finished maple neck, which is carved to a """"U""""-shape profile to guarantee a supportive and reassuring playing feel in the hand. Married to the neck is a bound rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 medium jumbo-sized frets that bear offset pearloid neo-classic thumbnail position inlays. The neck and fingerboard partnership establishes a confident playing feel, encouraging your fingers to roam freely. The 12-inch fingerboard radius allows your fretting hand to roll around in comfort, whilst string bends can be executed smoothly. The single cutaway body profile makes it significantly easier to reach the upper frets comfortably.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck is a Graph Tech nubone nut, which works in partnership with the vintage-style open-back tuning machines to uphold string tension and tuning integrity. Fitted to the G5420LH is an adjusto-matic bridge with a secured rosewood-based, which is paired with a glorious Bigsby Licensed B60 vibrato tailpiece. The hardware creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain, whilst the Bigsby offers meticulous control over vibrato.</p><h3> Blacktop Filter'Tron pickups </h3><p>Fitted to the body are two BlackTop Filter'Tron humbuckers in the neck and bridge positions. Designed to enhance the """"fat"""" timbre produced by the body, this pair produce an enviable tonal arsenal for you to play with. The neck position enhances the plucky articulation of the neck and fingerboard, whilst the bridge pickup draws more from the body, generating a thunderous charge when you want it.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of a three-way pickup selector toggle switch, which allows you to select either pickup independently or select both outputs simultaneously for a fuller tone. Each pickup has an independent volume knob, and both are connected to master volume and tone pots.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gretsch Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,632-632-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/17d7109d21148456450bb02b4dd0a1fa.jpeg,1,,FALSE,G5420LH Electromatic Hollowbody Left-Handed - Black,G5420LH Electromatic Hollowbody Left-Handed - Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Through a combination of vintage-style and updated technology, Gibson has captured the vibrant energy and character of a classic Les Paul, whilst exceeding the tonal demands of today's guitarists.</p><h3>Sleek Les Paul design</h3><p>As you'd expect, the body is crafted using classic combination of two-piece mahogany that has been combined with a grade A plain maple top. The mahogany has been treated to a 9-hole weight relief rout, which makes the body lighter and easier to wield, without losing any of that raw Les Paul power. The maple doesn't just look pretty either; it lends itself to a sweetly delivered high-end that allows this beauty to truly sparkle. The body protected by a smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer, which preserves that natural grain and paintwork to allow your Les Paul to age gracefully.</p><h3>Single-piece mahogany neck</h3><p>To create a confident playing feel, Gibson have fitted a single-piece mahogany neck using a solid mortise and tenon joint reinforced using Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive. You can rest assured that no matter how hard you play, the neck is built with durability at its heart. Thanks to its slimtaper profile, the neck is delightfully slender and accommodating most player's hands with ease.</p><p>Married to the neck is a heavenly rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. Cream binding along the fingerboard ensures seamless transitions between frets, whilst the standard 12-inch radius makes it a breeze to perform smooth string bends.</p><h3>Zebra '57 Classic humbuckers</h3><p>To create a tonal match for the sophisticated '60s/'70s aesthetic, the Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar is equipped with a Zebra '57 Classic in the neck position, and a Zebra '57 Classic Plus in the bridge. The depth and warmth of the mahogany is given the commanding presence it deserves, with a hearty mid to low-end energy flowing from the pickups, thanks to the wound Alnico II magnet-driven humbuckers. The crispness of the maple rings truly, offering a snappy counterpoint to the dense mahogany.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes via the pickup independent volume and tone controls, which allow you to sculpt and shape your tone with precision. Orange Drop capacitors ensure that the slightest of adjustments is executed as smoothly as possible, putting absolute tone control in your hands.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>The headstock is home to Grover's zamak locking tuners with an impressive 14:01 tuning ratio, so you can rest assured that no slipping will occur during any emphatic string bending. The strings meet the body via the nickel-plated zamak ABR bridge and nickel-plated aluminium stop bar tailpiece. From the tuning machines down to the tailpiece, everything is designed and fitted to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>Each Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar model is supplied with a classic Gibson hardshell case in brown to protect your pride and joy whether it is in storage or in transit. With the 2017 model you will also receive a Gibson USA multi tool, premium strap, polishing cloth, and owner's manual to help you to keep your Les Paul in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,461-461-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/953dc943e0573f1e04de29ce763a6f39.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar - Gold Top,Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar - Gold Top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

This gorgeous 12-string includes all the customary appointments you'd expect to see on a Taylor, with some fine touches that make this guitar truly unique. The Taylor 150E is built to the dreadnought body shape, giving it a solid mid to low-end power. The back and sides of the body are crafted from sapele laminate, reinforcing the lower-end charge. The laminate responds well to changes in temperature and humidity, making it very useful for those who like their guitar to travel with them wherever they go. The top is made from Sitka spruce - a favourite of Taylor's -, which has excellent resonant qualities. This allows it to project a loud sound with the utmost clarity. The top is reinforced by Taylor's 100 Series 12-string bracing, giving it more than adequate support whilst also allowing it to resonate fully.</p><p>For times when you are playing to a large crowd and need a bit more power, the 150E is fitted with Taylor's awesome Expression System. The all-magnetic acoustic guitar pickup system amplifies the natural sound of the 150E, without adding colouration or distortion to the signal. Three simple controls make it very easy to adjust your tone on the go - volume, bass and treble. The neck is made using sapele, which is married to a luxurious ebony fretboard. This neck/fingerboard combination offers a warm response to the crisp brightness of the 12 strings, allowing each and every note to ring out with clear articulation.</p><p>The finishing appointments across the guitar lend themselves beautifully to the stylish aesthetic and solid functionality of the 150E. The Tusq nut and saddle guarantee that string spacing is upheld perfectly, whilst the sustain produced by the strings is maintained beautifully. Die-cast chrome mini tuning machines retain tuning integrity with absolute precision. A decorative three-ring rosette surrounds the soundhole and a black pickguard protects the body below the soundhole from unwanted picks and scrapes.</p><p>The Taylor 150E is an excellent 12-string that offers shimmering notes with a sparkling complexity. If you're looking for a guitar that sounds amazing, looks gorgeous and travels well, then this is the perfect guitar for you.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Taylor Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,1027-1027-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/5a67bda331fc140e66ad1df1402b6d42.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Taylor 150E 12-String Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,Taylor 150E 12-String Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Now the guys at Gibson Custom have brought it back with historically accurate appointments to give you a reincarnation that is as close to the original as possible. This was one of the first Gibson sunburst models which has since become legendary and this new version brings it right up to date.</p><h3>MAPLE AND MAHOGANY</h3><p>In 1958 when Gibson first designed the original Les Paul Standard guitars, they would all feature a two-piece maple body top, and the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard indeed has a two-piece figured maple top. Figured maple is instantly eye-catching due to its flame-like texture while it also contributes to producing that vintage, '58 sound of the original.</p><p>The top is accompanied by mahogany in the back and sides which makes for the perfect partnership with the figured maple top to produce a strong, resonant output as authentic as those models which were first released in the late 50s. This version is given the 1950s style Les Paul body contour with no weight relief for a historically correct feel.</p><h3>VINTAGE CORRECT NECK</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard is fitted with a single-piece mahogany neck with a comfortable 1950's style Les Paul profile. It is firmly joined to the body using hot hide-glue which was a constitutional element of the original guitars. The neck also has a historic long-tenon neck joint which enables the guitar to precisely convey its classic tone.</p><p>Aboard the neck is a solid, one-piece Indian rosewood fingerboard which assists the mahogany in providing an all-round Les Paul sound. With 22 frets at your service, you can work your way up and down the neck in confidence thanks to the cellulose Trapezoid inlays.</p><h3>CUSTOM BUCKER PICKUPS</h3><p>Gibson have employed Custom Bucker pickups in the electronics of the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard, and consider them to be their best replica of PAF pickups yet. The Custom Buckers achieve an output that is as close to the original sound of a '58 guitar as you can imagine. Each pickup is powered by Alnico III magnets which deliver you a mix of epic ringing or deep rumble depending on the sound output that you require.</p><p>To help you control the rhythm and lead pickups, the guitar is fitted with two Volume and two Tone pots with matched 500k potentiometers and encased with gold top hats.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard has an ABR bridge with thumbwheels partnered with a lightweight aluminium stop bar tailpiece which enhances the overall intonation and sustain. At the top end of the guitar at the headstock we have reissue Kluson deluxe green keys made with nickel plated steel to uphold tuning integrity with accuracy.</p><p>Protecting the beautiful, hand-sprayed nitrocellulose finish on the body is a 1950's style cream pickguard which also really complements the guitar. The guitar also comes equipped with a reissue Les Paul case with a brown outer and pink fur lining to further protect this wonderful guitar.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,558-558-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/66db231f9c2eef0b283e589d59140e01.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul - Faded Tobacco,Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul - Faded Tobacco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The slender body with arched top create the perfect resting and playing position for the picking hand, whilst the deep double cutaway clears the way for your fretting hand to access the neck in its entirety. Basswood has been employed as the tonewood of choice, laying the foundation beautifully with a solid midrange energy that is infused with warmth. Paired with the Basswood is a cool quilted maple top, finished in a striking transparent red.</p><h3> Neck-through-body design </h3><p>The true neck-through-body construction has been a feature of Jackson models since 1980, and are revered due to their improved playability and superior sustain. The X Series Soloist maple neck benefits from this construction method, whilst also receiving graphite support rod reinforcement to extend the longevity of the neck's stability for many years to come, no matter what you throw its way on the road.</p><h3> Compound radius fingerboard </h3><p>Jackson pioneered the compound radius fingerboard design, which features a rounded profile at the nut that flattens towards the heel. The benefit of this design lies in its ability to create a more natural playing position for the fretting hand. Whether you're throwing in cheeky string bends, seamless legato or two-handed tapping across multiple strings, the rosewood fingerboard is more than happy to oblige you. Piranha tooth position inlays guide you along each of the 24 jumbo frets in style, whilst the single-ply neck binding offers seamless transitions between each fret.</p><h3> EMG active humbuckers </h3><p>The X Series Soloist is equipped with a pair of EMG active humbuckers in the neck and bridge positions to give this awesome model the beefy power it deserves. Fitted in the neck position is the EMG 85 and an EMG 81 in the bridge, a pairing favoured by many metallers for decades. The 81 offers an impressive sonic assault by making the most of the powerful ceramic magnets that give it incredible detail at ultra-high gain. The 85 offers a more rounded output, but no less impressive, that is fantastic for chunky mid-powered chops and palm-muted chugging. Simply put, there is a reason why so many love this setup, and once you have a go you'll hear why.</p><h3> Floyd Rose precision </h3><p>To ensure optimum intonation and sustain along with peerless vibrato control, Jackson have equipped the body with a Floyd Rose Special double locking 2-point tremolo. Paired with Floyd Rose R3 locking nuts, you can rest assured that once you tune up and lock in, your strings will faithfully adhere to your playing, no matter how punishing it may be.</p><p>To further the stability of the Jackson X Series Soloist SLATXMGQ3-6, Dunlop dual locking strap locks keep you locked-in to prevent the misery of a dropped neck or snapped headstock from holding you back as you rock out - wherever that may be.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Jackson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,923-923-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/2bf1dd9d4c97b93611fca440f5cdfdaf.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Jackson X Series Soloist SLATXMGQ3-6 Electric Guitar - Transparent Red,Jackson X Series Soloist SLATXMGQ3-6 Electric Guitar - Transparent Red,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The sophistication of the body finish, coupled with the sumptuous thinline hollowbody design makes the G5422TG very pleasing on the eye. Whether you're an amateur or a pro, you're bound to turns heads with this gorgeous guitar. As we've come to expect from Gretsch, only the finest appointments are included here, creating a guitar that is versatile in the studio, and resilient enough to cope with anything you can throw its way on the road.</p><h3> Bound double-cutaway body </h3><p>The body is shaped to a thinline hollowbody profile, making it very comfortable to perform with without compromising upon its ability to produce a full-bodied timbre. The 5-ply maple tonewood works perfectly with the body design to lay the foundation for a smooth midrange energy that offers a sweet bottom-end and sparkling yet softly rounded highs. The stylish over-sized bound f-holes that are shaped into the top, allow the acoustic timbre to ease through for a smooth, subtle projection. The top is bound to offer protection to the body edges, as well complementing the masterfully executed finish. Protection is offered to the paintwork in the form of a slender yet resilient gloss finish. A gold plexi pickguard finds its home on the body just below the pickups, proudly displaying a black Gretsch logo.</p><h3> Gloss-finished maple neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a smooth maple neck, which is crafted to a """"U""""-shape profile to create a fast-playing feel. Paired with the neck is a bound, 22-fret rosewood fingerboard that is adorned with pearloid hump-block position inlays. The 12-inch fingerboard radius means that performing string bends is a thankfully comfortable experience. The double-cutaway body profile means that each and every fret is within easy reach.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck you'll find a Graph Tech nubone nut, which works in partnership with the vintage-style open-back tuning machines to stabilise string tension and tuning integrity. Connected to the body is a smaller late-'50s G6120 bound headstock, which proudly shows off a white Gretsch logo. Fitted to the G5422TG is an adjusto-matic bridge with a secured rosewood-base, which is paired with a glorious Bigsby Licensed B60 vibrato tailpiece. The hardware creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain, whilst the Bigsby offers accurate and effortless control over vibrato.</p><h3> Blacktop Filter'Tron pickups </h3><p>Fitted to the body are two BlackTop Filter'Tron humbuckers in the neck and bridge positions. Designed to enhance the """"fat"""" timbre produced by the body, this pair produce an enviable tonal arsenal for you to play with. The neck position enhances the plucky articulation of the neck and fingerboard, whilst the bridge pickup draws more from the body, generating a thunderous charge when you want it.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of a three-way pickup selector toggle switch, which allows you to select either pickup independently or select both outputs simultaneously for a fuller tone. Each pickup has an independent volume knob, and both are connected to master volume and tone pots.</p><p>The Gretsch G5422TG Electromatic hollowbody guitar with Bigsby tailpiece is a divine model that is a joy to perform with.

Plus, the body features a quilted maple top that shines radiantly through the eye-catching finish.</p> <h3>Neck</h3> <p>The S670QM is fitted with a smooth maple neck which features the signature Ibanez Wizard III profile. The Wizard III neck is thin and flat which promotes faster playability. A bound rosewood fingerboard tops the neck which feels just right in the hand, facilitating grip and fret transitioning. The fingerboard hosts 24 frets, meaning you have a two-octave fretboard to explore fully. Offset white dot inlays decorate the frets to guide you along.</p> <h3>Quantum Pickups</h3> <p>The S670QM Spot Run is powered by a superb trio of Quantum pickups. The neck and bridge positions feature ceramic humbucking Quantum pickups, while the middle position employs an Alnico-powered Quantum single-coil pickup. The fusion of humbuckers and a single-coil pickup opens up a whole universe of tones, whether you're tearing out solos or using their responsive bass / midrange tones for complex chording.</p> <p>Master Volume and Tone controls allow you to shape your sound with precision, while a 5-way pickup switch blends and separates the pickups.</p> <h3>Hardware and Finish</h3> <p>The S670QM is fitted with an excellent Edge-Zero II tremolo bridge with a stud lock function that improves tuning stability even after plenty of heavy tremolo use. The tuners at the headstock also work alongside the bridge to ensure that each string remains in tune.</p> <p>The spectacular finish of this Spot Run model is matched up with Cosmo Black hardware. The S670QM Spot Run is yet another high quality electric guitar hailing from the Ibanez S line of first-rate instruments to appeal to the masses.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Ibanez Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,821-821-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/68e8f60e9583e043e70dc2b71eb05242.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Ibanez S670QM Electric Guitar - Sapphire Blue,Ibanez S670QM Electric Guitar - Sapphire Blue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Gibson have got the perfect mix of """"tradition and innovation"""", combining original, time-honoured appointments with some incredible upgrades to attract modern players.</p><h3>BODY</h3><p>As with the majority of Gibson electric guitars, the 2017 SG Standard HP has a mahogany body. One of the most radical features of the SG when it was first released was the double cutaway body, which is still the same today. The SG Standard HP is equipped with a fast access heel for exceptional, easy reach to every fret, further boosted by the double cutaway.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>A smooth, Soloist mahogany neck is fitted to the SG Standard HP, providing extra room to play with. The neck has a Slim Taper profile, a popular choice for those who have a preference towards a much faster playing style.</p><p>The neck is topped with a sumptuous, dark rosewood fingerboard with a 12 inch radius and 22 easy-to-reach frets. Classic Mother of Pearl trapezoid inlays decorate the frets, guiding you from one to the next with complete confidence. For unrestricted control over string action and better sustain there is a titanium zero-fret adjustable nut with locking feature.</p><h3>ELECTRONICS</h3><p>Gibson have employed a pair of classic humbucker pickups in the 2017 SG Standard HP, with a '57 Classic in the neck position and a '57 Classic + in the bridge position. The '57 Classic humbuckers are designed to accurately replicate the original PAF-style tone heard on the original SG models many years ago.</p><p>The controls follow suit on previous models, with four knobs for rhythm and lead Volume and Tone, plus a 3-way pickup toggle switch to shape your SG sound. With upgraded wiring for the 2017 model, the controls work brilliantly to offer the desired tone you're looking for. The chrome-plated knobs and switch tip are designed to improve grip, so even on a dark, hot stage you'll have no problem making adjustments.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>There is updated, modern chrome hardware featured on the SG Standard HP, from the bell-shaped truss rod cover, tuning keys, Gibson logo and crown on the headstock to the bridge, tailpiece and control knobs. The headstock is now fitted with an improved version of the G FORCE automatic tuning system. Retuning your strings is a doddle with this accurate system, plus it has been calibrated to prevent any unwanted noise or interference.</p><p>A traditional chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge is fitted to the lower bout of the body with titanium saddles joined by an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece with locking studs for top quality sustain and resonance.</p><p>The small teardrop pickguard is designed to both protect and complement the stunning finish of the SG Standard HP, while the white fingerboard binding on the neck also helps complete the look. Gibson include a premium Gibson aluminium hard case, strap and polishing cloth with the purchase of a 2017 SG Standard HP, enabling the new owner to keep it in the finest condition for years to come.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,483-483-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/d3e9ea98fe0b7357134472d81e560c7c.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson 2017 SG Standard HP Electric Guitar,Gibson 2017 SG Standard HP Electric Guitar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Whether you're looking for a guitar that yields to gentle fingerstyle playing or flatpicking, the 0001XAE can capably handle anything you throw at it.</p><p>The solid sitka spruce top is secured using an a-frame """"X-1"""" bracing pattern that gives it protection from buckling over time increasing the longevity of the top's reverberant qualities. The high-pressure laminate back and sides add depth to the lighter tonal qualities of the spruce, which means that although the body shape maybe smaller than a traditional dreadnought, it is capable of producing a high sonic output across the frequency spectrum. The high-pressure laminate also handles humidity and temperature changes very well, making it an excellent choice for touring artists who want a roadworthy workhorse.</p><p>The neck is cut to the modified low oval profile, allowing it to be cradled nicely with the fretting hand. The neck is constructed from rust stratabond. This is a dye impregnated wood veneer that has exceptional strength and durability, making it a perfect neck wood. A lightweight richlite fingerboard is home to 20 frets across a generous 25.4"""" scale length.</p><p>The 000X1AE comes fitted with the Fishman Sonitone electronics system, which contains an active soundhole-mounted preamp with a 1/4"""" input jack as well as volume and tone controls. The Tone control can be attenuated to help deliver a thicker or punchier sound, help drop out the midrange when finger-picking and add more depth and articulation for times when you want to strum hard.</p><p>Chrome enclosed tuning machines ensure that each string's tuning integrity is maintained throughout each performance and the black richlite bridge ensures their connection to the body is robustly guaranteed, giving you utter confidence in the guitar's ability to perform.</p><p>The body is protected beneath the soundhole by a decorative and functional tortoise colour pickguard, reducing the chances of nicking or scraping the sitka spruce whilst playing.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Martin Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,939-939-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/41cdfb8218fa336a41cc2b192c41d2b8.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Martin 000X1AE Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,Martin 000X1AE Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Modelled on designs that were popular in the early half of the 20th century, the G9521 offers outstanding build quality that is comprised of fine tonewoods, gig-ready hardware, and the highest quality appointments. Whether you're looking for a guitar to practise on, gig/record/travel with, this beauty is a bargain at such an affordable price.</p><h3> Sleek auditorium body </h3><p>The Style 2 G9521 triple-0 is shaped to the auditorium body shape, which offers a punchier mid-range emphasis than that of a dreadnought. This is due to the scaled-down dimensions of the guitar's waist, which in turn makes it a very comfortable model for resting on your knee during performances. Though it may be smaller than a dreadnought, it still boasts an impressive dynamic range, and can easily hold its own whether you're performing solo, or accompanying a vocalist/playing as part of an ensemble.</p><p>To ensure a confident mid-range warmth, the body back and sides have been built using laminated mahogany, which also holds up well in coping with changes in humidity and temperature (ideal attributes in a travel-friendly guitar). The top is built from solid spruce, which is a popular choice as a soundboard thanks to its impressive ability to project tones confidently. The top is reinforced using quartersawn X-bracing to prevent unwanted buckling or warping, whilst allowing it to resonate unimpeded.</p><h3> Sturdy mahogany neck </h3><p>Connected to the body is a full-length 24.875-inch mahogany neck, which guarantees a firm and unyielding playing support to perform on. To prevent unwanted stickiness or tackiness from holding you back, a subtle satin finish has been applied to the neck. Shaped to the slim """"C"""" profile, the neck sits comfortably in the hand. Paired with the neck is a 19-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with mother-of-pearl dot inlays to guide you.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>Starting at the headstock, you'll find vintage-style open-back tuning machines, which work dutifully alongside the bone nut to ensure uniform string tension and tuning integrity. The body is home to a rosewood bridge, which anchors each string securely to optimise intonation and sustain. Aged white neck binding traces from the headstock to the body, complementing the exquisite Appalachia Cloudburst finish perfectly.</p><p>The Gretsch Style 2 G9521 Triple-0 Auditorium Acoustic Guitar in Appalachia Cloudburst is great for taking to the stage with, chilling out or jamming with friends, and is ideal for those who want a model that travels well.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gretsch Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,658-658-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/c091be3d286a5de92f3072003a45152c.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Style 2 G9521 Triple-0 Auditorium Guitar - Appalachia Burst,Style 2 G9521 Triple-0 Auditorium Guitar - Appalachia Burst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Don't let the size fool you though. The Taylor GS Mini Mahogany is built to Taylor's uncompromisingly high-standards of quality and can more than hold its own against larger models. </p><p>The top is built using Solid Tropical Mahogany, a dense tonewood that delivers a very bright and punchy sound. The Mahogany top gives a short and snappy tone to the guitar but throughout its life can develop into an incredibly warm and natural soundboard. It is well suited to players who are looking for a tone with plenty of individuality and attitude. </p><p> The back and sides are constructed from Sapele laminate, which is composed of a filler layer between an interior and exterior layer of Sapele laminate. The beauty of employing laminate material in the GS Mini means that it is much more resilient than a solid tonewood when dealing with changes in humidity, making it an excellent guitar to take on your travels. </p><p> The neck has been fashioned from Sapele and fitted with a solid ebony fingerboard that houses 20 highly playable frets. To add an extra layer of protection to the wood the neck, back and sides have all been finished with a varnish. It is durable enough to protect from scratches and rubbing, whilst also being thin enough to allow the wood to resonate without interference.</p><p> The guitar's design is completed with a three ring rosette around the soundboard, chrome buttons and die-cast chrome tuners. A tortoise pickguard also adds protection to the body whilst maintaining the high-quality aesthetic.</p><p>The Taylor GS Mini Acoustic Guitar comes pickup-ready. Get yourself Taylor's ES-Go soundhole pickup and a screwdriver and within a few minutes you can set the guitar up to be plugged into an acoustic amp, recorder or PA system. The GS Mini makes setting up the ES-Go ridiculously easy, as it has all the right clips and holes already in place. As this is a simple pickup system it does not have built-in volume controls so Taylor have also created the V-Cable that allows you to control the volume. You can, of course, use any type of 1/4-inch instrument cable and rely on your own playing to control the volume.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Taylor Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,1106-1106-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/c56156366f8467996418d229109f359c.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Taylor GS Mini Mahogany Acoustic Guitar,Taylor GS Mini Mahogany Acoustic Guitar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

For over 180 years, Martin have developed and built truly high quality guitars using their limitless expertise and research. The DRS-2 has tonnes of tonal versatility and feels ultimately durable to play whether you're on stage or not. As always, Martin have employed the best and most sustainable types of tonewood to build the DRS-2 in order to produce an impeccable acoustic sound.</p><h3>DREADNOUGHT BODY</h3><p>The Martin DRS-2 takes on the traditional dreadnought body style which has been well revered and recognised for so many years thanks to its attractive appearance and tonal depth. Martin have employed a solid sitka spruce top for this model and have further reinforced the strength of the soundboard using their A-Frame ''X-1'' bracing technique. The inner bracing also expands the range of tones which the guitar can then produce giving it a fantastic Martin sound.</p><h3>TONEWOODS</h3><p>The back and sides of the DRS-2 are made up of sapele tonewood which is very sustainable and produces a range of strong low ends to more sparkling highs. Firmly joined to the body via a traditional Mortise and Tenon joint is a select hardwood neck that is shaped to a modified low oval profile which feels super easy to play. Accompanying the neck is a black richlite fingerboard with a total of 20 frets, 14 of which are open so you can access the higher notes more easily.</p><h3>FISHMAN SONITONE ELECTRONICS</h3><p>Beneath the soundhole, Martin have fitted the DRS-2 with the Fishman Sonitone preamp. The preamp has subtle volume and tone controls which are easy to adjust under the soundhole to suit your playing needs.

The new left handed version of the 114ce has a Grand Auditorium profile with a Venetian cutaway. Built using excellent materials, the 114ce is a superb guitar that responds to all musical styles making it a great all-rounder to have in your collection.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>The Grand Auditorium body shape was first introduced in 1994 and has remained the first choice for many musicians because it is so multifaceted. The left handed 114ce also has a Venetian cutaway, offering not just a clean sloping appearance but also providing full access to the neck.</p><p>Sitka Spruce is nearly always the choice of tonewood when it comes to making a Taylor acoustic, and this remains true in the 114ce. The top is reinforced with forward shifted pattern bracing which helps the guitar to sing with clarity and volume. The back and sides of the 114ce are made up of layered walnut, an exquisite tonewood which produces a versatile tonal range with deep lows, a punchy midrange and crisp highs.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>The Taylor patented sapele neck has a narrower 1 11/16 inch nut width, facilitating those big bar chords and faster playing methods. An ebony fingerboard tops the neck and is home to 20 frets, and of course you have full access to these thanks to the body's Venetian cutaway. Each fret movement is guided by the 4mm dot Italian acrylic inlays.</p><h3>ES2 Pickup</h3><p>The guitar's natural voice is transferred beautifully via the Expression System 2 pickup. This pickup is like no other due to its unique positioning behind the saddle. It has three individually calibrated sensors, this means that each note can be accurately and clearly heard. The pickup and Taylor's custom-designed """"professional audio""""-grade preamp work together to give the 114ce its excellent acoustic tones. Tweak your sound using the simple controls for Tone and Volume.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>Tuning stability is superb thanks to the chrome tuners fitted to the headstock. The Tusq nut and Micarta saddle also provide durability and enhanced sustain.</p><p>The natural body finish comes with matching neat appointments such as a three-ring soundhole rosette, black pickguard and black binding. Carrying the 114ce is made easy as Taylor include a lightweight protective gig bag with each one.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Taylor Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,1025-1025-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/e17b3a37e86e7db96111dfc2910e6690.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Taylor 2017 114ce Walnut Left Handed Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,Taylor 2017 114ce Walnut Left Handed Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Taking on the sophisticated single-cutaway style, but including modern-era appointments, the 2017 Les Paul Traditional T is a dream come true for purists who are seeking a no nonsense model that sounds as good as it looks.</p><h3> Classic Les Paul design </h3><p>In keeping with its predecessors, the 2017 Traditional T adheres strictly to the non-weight relieved Les Paul body design, giving it a weighty feel with a resilient sustain. The tonewood partnership here features a two-piece mahogany back, which is paired with an AA grade maple top. The finish has been treated to a slender yet durable layer of smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer to protect against premature wear.</p><h3> Classic rounded neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body via a classic mortis and tenon joint is the single-piece mahogany neck. Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive has been tasked with reinforcing the neck joint to maximise stability and strength. In keeping with the traditional approach, the neck has been shaped to the rounded profile, which gives the neck a more substantial feel in the hand.</p><p>Married to the neck is a sublime 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. The fingerboard has been increased in thickness, which makes it ideal for those who like to flex their playing muscles. Cream binding traces along the edge of the fingerboard to create seamless transitions between frets.</p><h3> Resilient, stage-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck you'll find the nylon nut, which continues the nod to the Les Paul's heritage whilst guaranteeing exceptional tone, sustain and durability. The headstock is angled to Gibson's customary 17-degrees to improve tuning stability and string tension, whilst the Gibson logo is proudly on display for all to see. The nickel-plated zamak vintage-style keystone tuning machines boast an impressive 14:01 tuning ratio, firmly securing your strings during each and every performance as you rock out.</p><p>The body is home to the aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with titanium saddles and locking thumbwheels, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar with locking studs. The bridge and tailpiece partnership works dutifully to ensure intonation and sustain is optimised so that your Les Paul sings beautifully, and with the richness it deserves.</p><h3>Burstbucker 1 and 2 humbucker pickups</h3><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional T Electric Guitar has been fitted with a Burstbucker 1 and 2 humbuckers, fitted in the neck and bridge positions respectively. The Alnico II-powered Burstbuckers translate the richness of the body tonewoods, and the articulation of the neck and fingerboard construction with impeccable clarity. Control over the pickups comes in the form of classic gold Top Hat knobs, which complement the stunning finish beautifully.Included Accessories</p><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional T Electric Guitar is supplied with its very own Gibson hardshell aluminium case with plush lined interior. Additional accessories include the Gibson USA multi-tool, premium strap, and polishing cloth to keep your new pride and joy in pristine working condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,470-470-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/2cc7555111d20041ef6510772042daee.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional T Electric Guitar - Honey Burst,Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional T Electric Guitar - Honey Burst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Across the tonal spectrum and throughout the dynamic range, the dreadnought-shape executes each note with distinction and clarity. The playing feel is robust and has a familiarity that makes it incredibly comfortable to play.</p><p>The DRSGT body is crafted using solid sapele for the back and sides, partnered up with a solid Sitka spruce top. The sapele generates loads of energy, which creates the thumping driving force that dreadnoughts are known for. The Sitka spruce top acts as the highly resonant soundboard, which projecting sound efficiently so that each and every note rings out truly and transparently.</p><p>Martin's A-frame """"X-1"""" top bracing pattern gives the Sitka spruce top all the support and freedom it needs to resonate fully to project sound efficiently. Thanks to this you have a wide dynamic range at your disposal that allows you to add deft creative texture to your performance.</p><p>A cool black pickguard protects the underside of the strings from unwanted nicks and chips, preserving the integrity of the soundboard for as long as possible. Black boltoran binding ensures the edging between the top and sides is guarded against accidental knocks and lends itself to the guitar's slick overall look.</p><p>The solid sipo neck and black richlite fingerboard create the perfect counterpoint to the powerful body. Your playing style is faithfully honoured thanks to the graceful articulation of each note. The neck has a layer of protection thanks to a gentle satin coating, allowing a fast-playing feel so that moving up and down the neck is an absolute delight.</p><p>The DRSGT comes fitted with the Fishman Sonitone USB electronic system. If you need a bit more power for a larger gig the 1'4"""" jack allows you to hook the guitar up to an amp, or whatever else you fancy. For recording straight into your DAW there is even a USB connection, making it even easier to get your songs down.</p><p>The black richlite bridge guarantees a seamless connection between your strings and the body - adding to the excellent sustain properties. Chrome enclosed tuning machines with small buttons carry out the task of maintaining tuning integrity with absolute precision, allow you to play exactly how you want to with total reassurance.</p><p>The Martin DRSGT is powerful electro acoustic that gives you a complete touring, recording guitar in one. If you're looking for a high-quality, versatile guitar then you've found it. You even get a Martin 345 hardshell case to carry it around in, so as soon as it arrives you're good to go!</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Martin Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,975-975-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/ea8c7a1ac803a4904546ce2ae18726f3.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Martin Road Series DRSGT Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,Martin Road Series DRSGT Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The X Series merged together all of the quality expected from any Martin guitar but at less of a cost so that more guitarists can take advantage of the Martin range. The DX1KAE has a Martin dreadnought body profile which has been put together using a range of fine materials to produce the Martin acoustic timbre we know and love.</p><h3>DREADNOUGHT BODY PROFILE</h3><p>The Martin DX1KAE has a D-14 platform and has the conventional dreadnought body frame to enable the guitar to produce a full sustain and a range of versatile tones. Martin have employed solid sitka spruce for the body top which is further strengthened by the A-Frame ''X-1'' bracing technique. This bracing not only adds stability to the guitar but expands the range of tones considerably. Martin designed the dreadnought body template many years ago but it is increasingly well-regarded as time goes on due to its fantastic sound and attractive appearance.</p><h3>TONEWOODS</h3><p>Hawaiian Koa is used to construct the back and sides of the DX1KAE because of its ability to resonate but also due to its striking natural pattern. The Koa has been high pressure laminated and given a clear coating for added protection. Securely joining the body by means of a traditional Mortise and Tenon joint is a birch laminate neck with a modified low oval shape for easy playability. A 20-fret black richlite fingerboard sits atop of the neck at a 25.4 inch scale length and feels wonderful to play, even for more complicated movements. It's worth noting that 14 of the 20 frets are open unlike many other acoustic guitars, so you can take advantage of those higher notes easily to the top of the neck.</p><h3>FISHMAN SONITONE ELECTRONICS</h3><p>Underneath the soundhole, Martin have included a Fishman Sonitone preamp. The preamp has subtle volume and tone controls which are easy to adjust under the soundhole to suit your playing needs. The Fishman Sonitone pickup does a great job of translating the sparkling acoustic sounds and tones of your guitar when plugged in.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The Martin DX1KAE has small chrome tuning keys to uphold tuning integrity with precision and accuracy, and the black richlite bridge ensures a solid connection with the strings which means you can perform with confidence.</p><p>Beneath the soundhole is a tortoise pickguard to not only protect the body from scratches but to give the natural hand-rubbed urethane finish a contrast in appearance.</p><p>The Martin DX1KAE is an outstanding electro acoustic guitar which has a huge tonal range and deep sound all at an affordable price.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Martin Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,956-956-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/7e8ff33ab48ce8c501b3d8e4873f7635.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Martin DX1KAE Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,Martin DX1KAE Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The BTe-Koa follows on from Taylor's previous Baby Taylor models, all of which are considered to be some of the world's best travel guitars thanks to their comfortable, compact sizing. Travelling musicians will be major fans of the BTe-Koa thanks to its unique voicing and versatile playability.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>The BTe-Koa retains the ever-popular dreadnought body shape and condenses it into a 3/4 size acoustic guitar. Despite the guitar's smaller size, that is not to say that its sound is compromised as a result, quite the contrary in fact. The body of the Baby Taylor has been made entirely from Koa tonewood which looks and sounds just sublime. Koa is a wood found in Hawaii and is quite the rarity in the world of guitar construction. The all-Koa body contributes an incredible tonal warmth yet also has a delicious, striking appearance. For reinforced strength and dependability, the soundboard features unique X-bracing.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>A tropical American mahogany neck is firmly fitted to the all-Koa body and has a slightly shorter 22 3/4 inch scale length, facilitating a faster playing technique. The neck is topped with a 19-fret ebony fingerboard which features pearloid dot inlays as a decorative guide, so you can move up and down the neck with confidence.</p><h3>Expression System Baby Electronics</h3><p>In order to amplify the BTe-Koa, Taylor have equipped it with the brilliant Expression System Baby (ES-B) onboard preamp / pickup. The onboard electronics can be described as including primary appointments of the Taylor Expression System 2 piezo pickup along with the addition of a very convenient digital chromatic tuner. You can make subtle tweaks to your sound using the simple Volume and Tone controls. When it is not in use for over three minutes, the ES-B preamp can switch itself off to save battery power and improve efficiency.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>The headstock is fitted with enclosed die-cast chrome plated tuning machines, upholding tuning integrity with precision. Sustain and intonation is improved thanks to a Tusq nut and saddle combined with the ebony bridge. Each BTe-Koa comes with a gig bag, an absolute must-have accessory for any travelling musician.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Taylor Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,1116-1116-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/0b90daaddf7935c22479aa811cb40086.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Taylor BTe-Koa Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,Taylor BTe-Koa Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Strengthened with a Taylor's Forward Shifted Pattern with Relief Rout, which also enhances tone and flexibility, the sitka spruce top of 414E offers a loud, bright tone with emphasised bass and trebles. Balancing this out are the solid African ovangkol back &amp; sides, which, although similar to rosewood, offers a fuller mid range. The top is gloss finished, while the back &amp; sides have been satin finished. A white binding and a tortoise pickguard finish things off nicely.</p><p>Joined to the body of the Taylor 414E Guitar is a satin-finished tropical mahogany neck. Topping this is a 20-fret ebony fingerboard with progressive dot inlays, sitting between a Tusq nut and saddle.</p><h3>Electronics</h3><p>Amplifying the natural sound of the Taylor 414E Electro Acoustic is Taylor's own onboard acoustic pickup and preamp pairing, the Expression System. Comprised of a Dynamic Body Sensor mounted to the soundboard, a Dynamic String Sensor embedded beneath the fretboard, and a discrete preamp this setup uses an all-magnetic acoustic guitar pickup system to ensure the warmth and natural tones of the Taylor 414E are retained when being amplified. What's more with the Expression System being built by Taylor it works seamlessly with their guitars. Controlling the electronics is easy with a set of non-intrusive controls, made up of a volume, bass, and treble.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Taylor Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,1078-1078-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/d650d6bd6d541ea4ffedfd1f3e3b888a.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Taylor 414E Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,Taylor 414E Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Taylor have years of guitar-building experience and knowledge, and are always trying to improve their models to keep up with the fast-paced, changing needs of artists and musicians all over the world. The left handed version of the 110e retains the quintessential dreadnought shape and blends it with high quality tonewoods and electronics for an excellent sound and feel.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>As mentioned, the 110e has a traditional non-cutaway dreadnought body profile, symmetrical and slick in appearance. Regardless of your preferred guitar-playing technique, the dreadnought can adjust to all of them, from hard picking to heavy strumming.</p><p>As with so many Taylor acoustics, the body top is constructed from Sitka Spruce due to its versatility and elasticity when it is played. The top features the Forward Shifted bracing pattern to reinforce the guitar. The Sitka Spruce is paired with layered walnut back and sides which produce a superb range of crisp highs, a punchy midrange and deep lows.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>The neck has a narrow 1 11/16 inch nut width which provides a slim feel in the hand, facilitating bar chords and faster playability. An ebony fingerboard hosts 20 frets on top of the neck with 4mm dot Italian acrylic inlays as a handy guide.</p><h3>ES2 Pickup</h3><p>The excellent Taylor Expression System 2 pickup system powers the amplified sound of the left handed 110e Walnut. This features the patented behind-the-saddle pickup design with three uniquely placed and individually calibrated pickup sensors. This exclusive design works with Taylor's custom """"professional audio""""-grade preamp to produce a responsive, full-bodied voice. Whether you're plugged into an amp or PA system, the 110e will sound just excellent by using the simple Tone and Volume controls.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>As you would expect with any Taylor guitar, the 110e is fitted with top quality hardware. Chrome tuners uphold tuning integrity with precision via the headstock, while a Tusq nut and Micarta saddle enhance sustain. To complete the look, the body has a black pickguard and decorative three ring soundhole rosette. For any passionate acoustic fan, the Taylor 110e Walnut has a beautiful combination of materials and craftsmanship for a wonderfully enjoyable playing experience.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Taylor Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,1019-1019-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/e52ca8ed9745078efd13862045a44ed6.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Taylor 2017 110e Walnut Left Handed Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,Taylor 2017 110e Walnut Left Handed Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Having built an outstanding reputation for creating flawless instruments that are as beautiful to look at as they are to play and hear, Taylor consistently pushes the boundaries and strives for perfection with every model they create. This particular version of the 812ce joins the neck with the body at the 12th fret as oppose to the 14th. As a result, the bridge is further back on the soundboard which delivers a deep, rich vintage tone with suprising projection from such a compact guitar.</p><p>The Taylor 812ce 12 Fret's body back and sides have been crafted from Indian rosewood, a delightfully rich and complex tonewood that produces a full and robust mid to low-end force. The top is made from Sitka spruce - a Taylor favourite - due to its excellent resonant properties that enable it to project huge sounds with the greatest of ease. The bright-sounding spruce works in harmony with the body to deliver inspirational tone and projection.</p><p>A gloss finish has been given to the body to protect from unwanted nicks and scrapes that could otherwise occur over the years. It also enables the guitar to cope with changes in humidity and temperature capably, making this a fantastic touring and gigging partner. On this model Taylor have created an even slimmer coating of gloss - down from 6mm to 3.5mm - without sacrificing on its protective abilities.</p><p>The neck is carefully crafted using a tropical mahogany, giving it an unquestionably sturdy feel in the hand. Married to the mahogany is a sumptuous smoked ebony fingerboard, giving a delightful surface to navigate along. The mahogany and ebony combine perfectly to create a highly resonant platform for the strings, guaranteeing that every note rings out with sparkling clarity. The neck has been treated to newly designed Mother-of-Pearl Element position inlays.</p><p>The Taylor 812ce 12 Fret benefits from Taylor's newly designed Expression System 2 (ES2). As part of their never-ending quest for better tone, they shifted their usual 'under-the-saddle' design as they found that by placing the pickup behind the saddle, a less brittle, brash and synthetic sound could be captured. This means that no matter how aggressively you play, the natural warmth produced by the tonewoods rings out beautifully without colouring the signal or blemishing the natural timbre of the 812ce.</p><p>The control layout features the same volume and tone control knobs as on the original Expression System, with Taylor changing the gain structure of the preamp slightly to make it a little hotter. When playing live, this subtle adjustment gives the 812e 12-fret the boost you need to be heard loud and clear.</p><p>Because the, 812ce 12 Fret Electro Acoustic is a guitar you are going to want to keep in peak condition over the years, Taylor have even included a brown Taylor branded deluxe hardcase making this one of the best packages out there for the most discerning of guitarists.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Taylor Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,1095-1095-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/5efc91bc6d266b45f4707b3650b4200f.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Taylor 812ce 12 Fret Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,Taylor 812ce 12 Fret Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active
