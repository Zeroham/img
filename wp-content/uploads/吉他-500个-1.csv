Limited to just 250 models worldwide, you'll have to move fast if you want to get your hands on one of these exclusive guitars.</p><h3> Classic Les Paul design </h3><p>Slash belting out legendary riffs on his Les Paul is one of the most iconic images in rock. The Gibson Custom Slash Les Paul takes on the customary tonewood single-customary body profile that we've all come to know and love. Lightweight mahogany establishes a firm and resounding midrange tonal foundation, infused with warm and a hearty sustain. Paired with this is a plain maple top, which is finished in a unique green Anaconda Burst paintwork that creates a striking visual aesthetic.</p><h3> Sturdy yet supple neck </h3><p>Connected to the body is a solid mahogany neck, which is fitted using a long tenon joint for improved sustain, and reinforced with a hide glue fit. The profile is shaped to Slash's custom taper, with a .910-inch depth at the 1st fret extending to a 1.05-inch depth at the 12th fret. The custom taper feels fast in the hand, and accommodates speedy solos to be executed with ease.</p><h3> Luxurious fingerboard </h3><p>Paired with the neck is a divine rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. The classic Les Paul single-cutaway opens up access to the highest frets, giving you free rein to let your fingers roam freely. Binding guarantees that seamless transition between frets are the norm, removing unwanted obstacles to maximise that lightning fast playing feel.</p><h3> Slash Signature Seymour Duncan pickups </h3><p>It is only fitting that the Gibson Custom Slash Les Paul be equipped with Slash's Signature Seymour Duncan APH-1 and APH-2 pickups. Since the recording of the seminal Guns N' Roses' album """"Appetite for Destruction"""", Slash has favoured the APH-1, with Seymour Duncan creating the APH-2 in its visage. The intensity of Slash's playing style is magnified when these pickups are cranked, but also retain a subtlety when rolled back during more intimate moments. Control over the pickups comes in the form of 500K CTS Volume and Tone pots, with hand-wired harness that feature Sprague Orange Drop capacitors, so that no matter how minor the attenuation, you have the smoothest of control with absolute precision. A Switchcraft toggle switch affords the same level of precision when changing between the bridge and neck pickups.</p><h3> Immaculate hardware </h3><p>The body is home to a nickel-finished lightweight aluminium ABR-1 bridge, which creates a seamless transition between strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain. Every inch of the Gibson Custom Slash Les Paul has been pored over to ensure it is completed to the highest possible standard. A brown/pink Custom Shop case is supplied with every model to guarantee that your pride and joy is well protected for many years to come.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,504-504-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/e616c271cde2d4c8ecd46b54519e5e7e.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Custom Slash Les Paul Plain Top Electric Guitar - Anaconda Burst","Gibson Custom Slash Les Paul Plain Top Electric Guitar - Anaconda Burst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Throughout their long-standing working relationship, both Ibanez and Vai have benefited from their fruitful collaborations, creating some truly stunning models along the way. With their latest incarnation of the Jem, this is one to be treasured and appreciated. </p> <h3> Body </h3> <p> Adhering to the classic body design - complete with unique """"monkey grip"""" to aid in performing flashy stage manoeuvres -, the sleek and slender Super-Strat body profile has been crafted using lightweight American Basswood. Thanks to the wood's character, it produces a delightfully balanced tonality that enables the full sonic spectrum to be manipulated with the greatest of ease.

Paired with the neck is a maple fingerboard, which is home to 24-frets that are a guitarist's dream. Adorning the fingerboard is a divine """"Tree of Life"""" inlay, which traces the gorgeous body finish all the way up to the headstock. </p> <h3> Hardware </h3> <p> Fitted to the body is a responsive and easy to control Edge-Zero II locking tremolo bridge, so you can dive and wail to your heart's content, safe in the knowledge that the bridge will return to original position smoothly and swiftly. The chrome black hardware is understated, and complements the finish beautifully. </p> <h3> Electronics </h3> <p> The Jem77P is equipped with trio of DiMarzio pickups: Gravity Storm humbucking pickups in the neck and bridge positions, an Evolution single-coil pickup in the middle position. Between the three pickups you have a universe of tonal exploration ahead of you. Control couldn't be simpler, with a master volume and a master tone pot to shape and sculpt your output, as well as a 5-way pickup selector switch. </p> <p> The Jem has been turning heads since its introduction over 25 years ago, and with the Ibanez Jem77P Steve Vai Signature Guitar with Blue Floral Pattern they've done it again. Visually stunning, sonically brilliant, tonally diverse, and a joy to play. What more could any guitarist desire?

Now the guys at Gibson Custom have brought it back with historically accurate appointments to give you a reincarnation that is as close to the original as possible. This was one of the first Gibson sunburst models which has since become legendary and this new version brings it right up to date.</p><h3>MAPLE AND MAHOGANY</h3><p>In 1958 when Gibson first designed the original Les Paul Standard guitars, they would all feature a two-piece maple body top, and the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard indeed has a two-piece figured maple top. Figured maple is instantly eye-catching due to its flame-like texture while it also contributes to producing that vintage, '58 sound of the original.</p><p>The top is accompanied by mahogany in the back and sides which makes for the perfect partnership with the figured maple top to produce a strong, resonant output as authentic as those models which were first released in the late 50s. This version is given the 1950s style Les Paul body contour with no weight relief for a historically correct feel.</p><h3>VINTAGE CORRECT NECK</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard is fitted with a single-piece mahogany neck with a comfortable 1950's style Les Paul profile. It is firmly joined to the body using hot hide-glue which was a constitutional element of the original guitars. The neck also has a historic long-tenon neck joint which enables the guitar to precisely convey its classic tone.</p><p>Aboard the neck is a solid, one-piece Indian rosewood fingerboard which assists the mahogany in providing an all-round Les Paul sound. With 22 frets at your service, you can work your way up and down the neck in confidence thanks to the cellulose Trapezoid inlays.</p><h3>CUSTOM BUCKER PICKUPS</h3><p>Gibson have employed Custom Bucker pickups in the electronics of the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard, and consider them to be their best replica of PAF pickups yet. The Custom Buckers achieve an output that is as close to the original sound of a '58 guitar as you can imagine. Each pickup is powered by Alnico III magnets which deliver you a mix of epic ringing or deep rumble depending on the sound output that you require.</p><p>To help you control the rhythm and lead pickups, the guitar is fitted with two Volume and two Tone pots with matched 500k potentiometers and encased with gold top hats.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard has an ABR bridge with thumbwheels partnered with a lightweight aluminium stop bar tailpiece which enhances the overall intonation and sustain. At the top end of the guitar at the headstock we have reissue Kluson deluxe green keys made with nickel plated steel to uphold tuning integrity with accuracy.</p><p>Protecting the beautiful, hand-sprayed nitrocellulose finish on the body is a 1950's style cream pickguard which also really complements the guitar. The guitar also comes equipped with a reissue Les Paul case with a brown outer and pink fur lining to further protect this wonderful guitar.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,544-544-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/0553481300f49443f3f68d82ccc50f15.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul - Ice Tea","Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul - Ice Tea",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

It first arrived in 1960, and since then, this limited edition model has had many upgrades. Gibson have employed Adirondack red spruce in the guitar's construction, an eminent tonewood that looks and sounds just stunning.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>The Hummingbird is well-renowned as being Gibson's first square-shoulder dreadnought acoustic, and this recent limited edition retains that historic shape. This flat top acoustic has an AA-grade Adirondack red spruce body top which is radiused with scalloped bracing; this improves the guitar's ability to resonate, while augmenting its vintage acoustic voice.</p><p>The back and sides of this Hummingbird Red Spruce guitar are constructed from mahogany, a popular tonewood known for its sonic warmth. The warm Vintage Cherry Sunburst finish is meticulously done by hand using a finer grit sandpaper, giving the Hummingbird its VOS true vintage visual aesthetic.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>A mahogany neck is firmly fitted to the body via the compound dovetail joint for improved resonance. The neck is shaped to a round profile, offering a smooth playing feel. Aboard the neck is a rosewood fingerboard, presenting you with 20 frets and decorated beautifully with Mother-of-Pearl parallelogram inlays.</p><p>The neck and fingerboard feel more comfortable than ever thanks to the softened fingerboard edge which is designed to fit perfectly in the hand. Gibson have gone the extra mile to make this limited edition Hummingbird feel like the best acoustic playing surface, and this is a result of the German-engineered, hand-finished Plek technology used in the construction of all Gibson acoustics.</p><h3>Electronics</h3><p>Gibson have employed the incredibly flexible LR Baggs VTC pickup system to amplify the Hummingbird Red Spruce. The LR Baggs VTC pickup has a subtle construction and sits just under the saddle. This pickup system is unparalleled in the world of acoustic amplification, working relentlessly alongside the guitar itself to provide the truest acoustic voice. The controls for Volume and Tone sit just beneath the soundhole and are easy to adjust, making sound control incredibly simple.</p><h3>Hardware and Finish</h3><p>The lower bout of the Hummingbird is fitted with a traditional belly up rosewood bridge, and like the fingerboard, the bridge is treated with a new finishing oil which gets right into the wood to ensure that it will last even longer.</p><p>The headstock of the Hummingbird is equipped with gold Gotoh Keystone tuning keys, accurately maintaining the tuning of each string in conjunction with the Tusq saddle.</p><p>The Hummingbird Red Spruce is a limited edition model whereby there are only approximately 50 of these worldwide that have been hand-made! This exquisite Vintage Cherry Sunburst acoustic has a real vintage feel and appearance, and its traditional casted Hummingbird pickguard adds to it. Gibson also supply a protective black hardshell case with each purchase as well as a Gibson Acoustic Owner's Manual.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,517-517-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/e221c526293ccafcd0fbebed50f895d3.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Hummingbird Red Spruce Acoustic - Vintage Cherry Sunburst VOS","Gibson Hummingbird Red Spruce Acoustic - Vintage Cherry Sunburst VOS",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Thanks to some modern appointments and ingenious work from the Gibson Memphis team, the ES-275 Custom is perfect for rock, blues, and just about anything your heart desires.</p><h3>Classic design</h3><p>The ES-275 Custom is built with a completely hollow body and an arched top, which enables it to generate a powerful timbre. By employing 3-ply figured maple/poplar/maple in the construction of the body, the ES-275 resonates freely thanks to quartersawn Adirondack spruce bracing, whilst receiving support to prevent against unwanted warping over time. The stylish sunset burst finish is paired with premium appointments that include a sumptuous multi-bound tortoise pickguard, which obscures one of the two lovingly carved f-holes. The paintwork is treated to a coating of gloss nitrocellulose lacquer, which prevents any premature wear and tear from blemishing the beautiful finish.</p><h3>Sturdy mahogany neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a sturdy quartersawn mahogany neck, which is shaped to the ever so comfortable rounded """"C"""" profile. Paired with the neck is a glorious dark rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with mother of pearl full block inlays to guide your way in style. The neck features rolled binding to make transitions along its entire length as smooth as possible. Thanks to the thinline body shape and single-cutaway profile, the upper frets are within comfortable reach to give you total freedom to explore the fingerboard in its entirety.</p><h3>Memphis Historic Spec pickups</h3><p>To bring the best out of the 2018 ES-275 Custom Archtop, Gibson have designed a pair of Memphis Historic Spec humbuckers to dutifully translate the rich timbre of the guitar. The hand-wired control assembly with Orange Drop capacitors and matched 550K pots afford precision attenuation of volume and tone levels.

Plus, the Ebony finish of this model is complemented beautifully by gold hardware.</p><h3>Classic Combination</h3><p>As with many Les Paul guitars before now, the Modern Les Paul Axcess Custom features the conventional partnership of maple and mahogany.

Each of the pickups are powered by Alnico magnets which adds to their beefy output. Whether you're playing potent leads or thick rhythm, the Modern Les Paul Axcess Custom will duly respond.</p><p>At the lower bout of the body there are two 500K Push-Pull Pots for Tone Control and Coil Splitting, and two 500K Pots for Volume Control accompanied by a Switchcraft toggle switch.</p><h3>Hardware and Finish</h3><p>A new addition to the Modern Les Paul Axcess Custom is the Apex headstock.

Unlike the Les Paul, the SG has a double cutaway, innovative for its time, and it was met with instant fame. The 2017 SG Standard Traditional model remains the leader of the modern SG range, combining quintessential SG sound and appearance with up-to-date appointments and playing feel.</p><h3>BODY</h3><p>The most recognisable feature of the Gibson SG is its double-horned cutaway body, a feature which made it stand out among previous Gibson guitars at the time of its creation. In line with history, the 2017 SG Standard T body is constructed from mahogany, a popular choice of tonewood for the Gibson luthiers thanks to its superb sound delivery.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>A single-piece mahogany neck is securely joined to the body via a traditional Mortis and Tenon joint using the most reliable Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive. The neck is shaped to the Slim Taper profile, offering faster, more comfortable playability.</p><p>The neck is topped with a 12 inch radius rosewood fingerboard with 22 frets, all are readily available thanks to the body's double cutaway. The rosewood is thicker than usual, contributing to the overall sonic depth of the SG. The frets are also decorated with traditional white trapezoid inlays to guide you. Gibson have included a Tektoid nut that is self-lubricating for a better return to pitch and improved sustain.</p><h3>CLASSIC HUMBUCKERS</h3><p>The 2017 SG Standard T is kitted out with a pair of '57 Classic humbucker pickups powered by the outstanding Alnico II magnets. As soon as you plug in and play, the two humbuckers work relentlessly together to give you that classic PAF-style Gibson tone.</p><p>As with many Gibson models, the 2017 SG Standard T features the four-knob control setup for rhythm and lead Volume and Tone. The knobs have classic black tophats and are accompanied by a 3-way pickup toggle switch.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The headstock has a traditional appearance, with a black and white bell truss rod cover with """"SG"""" stamped on, alongside the usual Gibson logo decal and crown. For total tuning accuracy, the SG is equipped with locking Grover Kidney-button tuners with a precise 14:01 gear ratio.</p><p>The body is fitted with a traditional chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge and an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece for exceptional sustain and resonance.</p><p>The 2017 SG Standard T model features a smaller teardrop-style black pickguard, similar to that found on the models released throughout the early 1960s' SGs. To enable the owner to keep the SG well looked after, Gibson include a hardshell brown case with the purchase, as well as a strap and polishing cloth to get you performance-ready right away.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,497-497-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/49813010dc79832157905cd7654c0ca9.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 SG Standard T Electric Guitar - Heritage Cherry","Gibson 2017 SG Standard T Electric Guitar - Heritage Cherry",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

One of the first solidbody guitars became an overnight success much to Gibson's surprise, and this was the now renowned Firebird. This astonishing guitar was the brainchild of car designer Ray Dietrich who worked alongside Ted McCarty (the then Gibson President). With its unique shape derived from car tailfins, this new Gibson was a revolution, and the 2017 Traditional rendition keeps many of the original historic features with some added new and exclusive appointments.</p><h3>BODY</h3><p>Unlike guitars at the time of its birth in the early 1960s, the Firebird had a reverse-style body and a longer right horn, which it retains today. The neck-through-body is constructed from mahogany, a preferred tonewood for Gibson. The mahogany body feels lightweight and comfortable, reducing fatigue especially for performers and live musicians.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>As mentioned, the 2017 Firebird T has a neck-through-body construction, which boosts sustain and grants full access to all the frets, even the upper registers. The neck is made up of mahogany and walnut and shaped to the classic Firebird Slim Taper profile for a faster, more comfortable playing feel in the hand of a modern guitarist.</p><p>The neck is topped with a thicker rosewood fingerboard providing you with 22 frets to enjoy. The use of this thicker rosewood boosts tonal depth produced by the guitar for a high quality sound output. Gibson have fitted a Tektoid nut that is self-lubricating for a better return to pitch and improved sustain.</p><h3>ELECTRONICS</h3><p>The 2017 Firebird T is equipped with a pair of Mini Humbucker pickups, with one in the neck position and another in the bridge position. The original Firebirds were also fitted with this superb pickup duo, and the 2017 version will still deliver those PAF-style authentic Gibson tones.</p><p>Featuring the usual controls for rhythm and lead Volume and Tone and a 3-way toggle pickup switch, you can shape your tone to suit your playing needs. Each control has a black tophat with a silver insert, complementing the body finish.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The Firebird T headstock is directly fitted with the exceptional Steinberger Gearless tuning keys set to a 40:01:00 gear ratio. Their rare design and precise ratio ensure consistency in tuning each string as well as improving the overall sustain.</p><p>To further boost sustain and resonance there is a traditional chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge and an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece.</p><p>To protect and complement the body's smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer finish is a 3-ply white Firebird pickguard with the quintessential gold Firebird on it. To enable the guitarist to look after this wonderful guitar as best as possible, Gibson include a brown Firebird hardshell case, premium strap and polishing cloth.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,438-438-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/fb9aa505ad613e1b714e74170a2b4f40.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 Firebird T Electric Guitar - Vintage Sunburst","Gibson 2017 Firebird T Electric Guitar - Vintage Sunburst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Taylor's most popular body shape, Grand Auditorium, has been chosen for the body of the Taylor K24ce Electro Acoustic Guitar, because of its versatility of tone, especially in the midrange, and note definition, which make it equally capable for both flatpicking and strumming styles. Also making up the Taylor K24ce's silhouette is a Venetian cutaway. This addition gives unrestricted access to the upper frets and adds to the beauty of the instrument, with its soft, round curves.</p><p>Also of note in the construction of the Taylor K24ce Electro Acoustic Guitar is the bracing used for its top: CV with Relief Rout. Along with other refinements, this bracing loosens the edges of the top, whilst retaining structural integrity, to increase flexibility and give a fuller, fatter sound without affecting articulation.</p><p>The body of the Taylor K24ce Electro Acoustic Guitar is unmistakably Hawaiian Koa in its construction. This beautiful wood is more than just a pretty face, however. Tonally it sits nicely between mahogany and maple, with mahogany's midrange and maple's top end. It is one of those woods that likes to played and rewards its owner over time; starting out bright and focussed, but developing a wider midrange and a richer, sweeter, more resonant tone.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>Joined to the body of the Taylor K24ce Electro Acoustic Guitar is a mahogany neck, topped by an ebony fingerboard with the gorgeous Island Vine inlay spanning its length, which also appears on the headstock. Like the body, this has an Indian rosewood binding that splits up the design nicely.</p><h3>Electronics</h3><p>Although an excellent acoustic guitar, the Taylor K24ce Electro Acoustic Guitar also gives you the option of plugging into an amplifier or PA system. Ensuring that none of the guitar's character is lost when travelling from guitar to speaker, Taylor have developed their own pickup system, now in its second version, the Taylor Expression System 2.</p><p>Through their research Taylor found that the best place for a pickup is behind, rather than under the saddle, and this is where you will find the pickup on the Taylor K24ce Electro Acoustic Guitar. Made up of three strategically placed sensors installed through the bridge, the Taylor Expression System 2 gets the best from the guitar. It also gives you a set of three discreet controls knobs at the upper bout, for quick and easy tone shaping. These controls are: volume, treble, and bass.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1120-1120-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/02deed32bd9c2d5fd9b82c9c47c09cb3.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor K24ce Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor K24ce Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

From the meticulously crafted tonewoods to the heavenly Aquamarine finish, this model exudes high quality down to the tiniest detail.It is fair to say that the Gibson Memphis team have outdone themselves with this one.</p><h3>Classic ES-335 design</h3><p>The body is carved to the instantly recognisable ES Series shape, with elegant curves and sweeping edges that make it such a joy to behold. The 3-ply figured maple/poplar/maple tonewood construction lends itself beautifully to the semi-hollowbody shape, by generating a wide dynamic range that is infused with warmth and a balanced frequency range. Present and correct is the maple centre block that prevents the energetic character of the ES-335 from running away with itself, so that what remains is an output that sounds as sweet at low or high volume levels. The lightweight feel is matched by the solid construction of the body, which guarantees resilience throughout each and every performance.</p><p>However, it is the finish that sets the 2018 ES-335 Figured model apart. The Aquamarine paintwork complements the figured maple top in immaculate fashion, whilst single-ply cream binding adds to the visual aesthetic fittingly.</p><h3>Strong and supportive neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a quartersawn mahogany neck, which establishes a sturdy feel in the hand for total reassurance as you play. The neck is shaped to the rounded """"C"""" profile for a substantial yet manageable feel in the hand. The rolled binding enables seamless transitions along the neck for a speedy playing experience. The neck is paired with a luxurious rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with pearloid small block position inlays to guide your way in style.</p><h3>Memphis Historic Spec pickups</h3><p>The 2018 ES-335 Figured is equipped with a pair of Memphis Historic Spec humbuckers, which are designed with meticulous attention to detail in order to translate the ES-335's balanced timbre with the utmost fidelity. From rich and resounding mid to low-end energy through a punchy midrange to a searing high-end output, these pickups deliver a highly versatile tonal palette.</p><p>As noted above, the Gibson Memphis team have spared nothing in securing a high-end product. The hand-wired MTC Premiere control assembly with Orange Drop capacitors and 550K matched pots offer peerless volume and tone adjustment, giving you total mastery over your pickup and tone control.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The body is equipped with an ABR-1 bridge with titanium saddles to increase clarity, definition and sustain. The aluminium tailpiece with locking studs reinforces the bridge's consistency, whilst the Grover """"Milk Bottle"""" Rotomatic tuners uphold tuning integrity dutifully throughout the most energetic of performances.</p><p>Each Gibson Memphis 2018 ES-335 Figured Electric Guitar is supplied with a hardcase to protect your model at home and on the go, as well as an accessory kit to help keep it in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,540-540-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/63019eba5ea328446526ea6953c42b8e.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Memphis 2018 ES-335 Figured Electric Guitar - Aquamarine","Gibson Memphis 2018 ES-335 Figured Electric Guitar - Aquamarine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

With the sheer attitude of the humbucker pickups combined with its special design, it's no wonder that famous guitarists such as Alex Lifeson and Tommy Shaw have made it their primary choice. This is purely down to its incredible feel, or as Gibson say, """"contoured for comfort"""", making it the ultimate choice for any electric guitar player.</p><h3>MAPLE AND MAHOGANY</h3><p>An often prevalent feature in the design of a Les Paul is the need for a maple / mahogany partnership. The CS Les Paul Axcess has a top constructed from two pieces of maple which is then paired with a solid mahogany body. For the Axcess model, it has a thinner body depth which consequently ensures the guitar has a lighter feel, perfect for the performing musician who has to stand on stage for hours on end. Furthermore, the back of the body has a belly carve which ensures the guitar stays close to your body while you play, providing you with a flawless feel.</p><h3>MAHOGANY NECK</h3><p>A durable, one-piece mahogany neck is firmly fitted to the body and is shaped to the Les Paul Axcess profile. One of the best features of the guitar has to be its Axcess heel carve, which is what allows you to explore each and every fret without obstruction. There are 22 frets at your service on a sumptuous richlite fingerboard, paired with multi-ply binding which contributes to effortless fret transitions.</p><h3>496R AND 498T PICKUPS</h3><p>The CS Les Paul Axcess is equipped with 496R and 498T pickups which deliver an illuminous range of searing humbucker tones. Each pickup is powered by a ceramic magnet with #42 enamel wiring for a truly powerful sound delivery. For biting, crunchy rock or clean tones full of sustain, the pairing of a 496R and 498T pickup is sublime.</p><p>Four control knobs sit to the lower bout of the guitar for lead and rhythm Volume and Tone, and a three-way pickup switch allows you to adjust your sound to suit your playing needs.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>Gibson Custom have opted for a traditional hardware choice in the appointment of a Tune-o-Matic bridge with a stopbar tailpiece, both of which are gold, standing out against the beautiful gloss finish of the guitar. This conventional partnership improves the sustain and intonation of this superb Les Paul.</p><p>The quintessential Gibson Custom headstock is fitted with gold LP Custom tuning keys which work tirelessly to uphold tuning integrity.</p><p>The CS Les Paul Axcess includes a black LP Custom hard case for added protection when out on the road, as well as a Gibson Custom Shop Certificate of Authenticity.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,524-524-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/60910e7bf01616678c8182fced03fed6.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson CS Les Paul Axcess Stopbar Electric Guitar - Ebony","Gibson CS Les Paul Axcess Stopbar Electric Guitar - Ebony",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Through a combination of vintage-style and updated technology, Gibson has captured the vibrant energy and character of a classic Les Paul, whilst exceeding the tonal demands of today's guitarists.</p><h3>Sleek Les Paul design</h3><p>As you'd expect, the body is crafted using classic combination of two-piece mahogany that has been combined with a grade A plain maple top. The mahogany has been treated to a 9-hole weight relief rout, which makes the body lighter and easier to wield, without losing any of that raw Les Paul power. The maple doesn't just look pretty either; it lends itself to a sweetly delivered high-end that allows this beauty to truly sparkle. The body protected by a smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer, which preserves that natural grain and paintwork to allow your Les Paul to age gracefully.</p><h3>Single-piece mahogany neck</h3><p>To create a confident playing feel, Gibson have fitted a single-piece mahogany neck using a solid mortise and tenon joint reinforced using Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive. You can rest assured that no matter how hard you play, the neck is built with durability at its heart. Thanks to its slimtaper profile, the neck is delightfully slender and accommodating most player's hands with ease.</p><p>Married to the neck is a heavenly rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. Cream binding along the fingerboard ensures seamless transitions between frets, whilst the standard 12-inch radius makes it a breeze to perform smooth string bends.</p><h3>Zebra '57 Classic humbuckers</h3><p>To create a tonal match for the sophisticated '60s/'70s aesthetic, the Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar is equipped with a Zebra '57 Classic in the neck position, and a Zebra '57 Classic Plus in the bridge. The depth and warmth of the mahogany is given the commanding presence it deserves, with a hearty mid to low-end energy flowing from the pickups, thanks to the wound Alnico II magnet-driven humbuckers. The crispness of the maple rings truly, offering a snappy counterpoint to the dense mahogany.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes via the pickup independent volume and tone controls, which allow you to sculpt and shape your tone with precision. Orange Drop capacitors ensure that the slightest of adjustments is executed as smoothly as possible, putting absolute tone control in your hands.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>The headstock is home to Grover's zamak locking tuners with an impressive 14:01 tuning ratio, so you can rest assured that no slipping will occur during any emphatic string bending. The strings meet the body via the nickel-plated zamak ABR bridge and nickel-plated aluminium stop bar tailpiece. From the tuning machines down to the tailpiece, everything is designed and fitted to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>Each Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar model is supplied with a classic Gibson hardshell case in brown to protect your pride and joy whether it is in storage or in transit. With the 2017 model you will also receive a Gibson USA multi tool, premium strap, polishing cloth, and owner's manual to help you to keep your Les Paul in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,464-464-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/1ef23b25726f3bd285bfea0bdca27ab9.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Guitar - Green Ocean Burst","Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Guitar - Green Ocean Burst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

With its distinct shape and style, Gibson have revamped the Flying V with a version for 2017, taking primary features from the original 1958 model as its foundation. Kitted out with Dirty Fingers pickups to deliver a classic, heavy rock tone, the 2017 Flying V sounds as good as ever.</p><h3>V-SHAPE BODY</h3><p>The 2017 version of the legendary Flying V has a body constructed entirely from mahogany, hand-chosen by the expert luthiers at Gibson USA to improve the guitar's ability to resonate freely. The body has a lightweight feel designed to appeal to the masses.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>Firmly fitted to the Flying V body is a smooth mahogany neck, the tonewood of choice for Gibson. The neck is fitted using the traditional Mortis and Tenon joint using the extra tough Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive. The neck of a Flying V is known for its ultra fast Slim Taper profile, and the 2017 model retains this advantageous feature. Due to the radical shape of the Flying V it allows for full access to the upper frets of the neck.</p><p>Aboard the neck is a thicker, 12 inch radius grenadillo fingerboard with 22 frets on offer. Gibson have selected a thicker tonewood for the fingerboard due to its rich sonic contribution to the modern Flying V. The light shade of the fingerboard is complemented by white dot inlays to guide you. The neck also features a Tektoid nut which lubricates itself, consequently improving sustain and ensuring accuracy when returning to pitch.</p><h3>DIRTY FINGERS</h3><p>Gibson have chosen an incredibly powerful, robust pair of ceramic humbucker pickups to give the Flying V some real clout. Dirty Fingers humbucker pickups are fitted in the neck and bridge positions. Gibson may well have their most powerful set of pickups fitted to this Flying V, ideal for hard, heavy rock but versatile enough in many other musical genres.</p><p>Gibson have included two Volume controls plus a Master Tone knob joined by a 3-way toggle pickup switch.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>For reliable, precise tuning, Gibson have employed Grover kidney-button tuners on the headstock. The tuners are constructed from a lightweight Zamak material and have a 14:01 gear ratio.</p><p>A traditional chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge and an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece is fitted to the body ensuring enhanced sustain and resonance.</p><p>Stand-out visual appointments include the protective 3-ply white pickguard, the silver Gibson logo on the arrowhead and black top hat control knobs with silver inserts. To keep the guitar in the best possible condition, Gibson include a Flying V hard shell brown case, a set of handy tools plus a Gibson USA Owner's Manual.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,443-443-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/2832a5d72607106c4cd53d83ff7af412.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 Flying V Traditional Electric Guitar","Gibson 2017 Flying V Traditional Electric Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Delivering the lush tonal complexity of a hollowbody with the classic chime and jangle that comes with the increased string count, Gretsch has created a breath-taking model that is equally at home in the studio and on the stage. Packed with a pair of Blacktop Filter'Tron pickups, you can play the mesmerising timbre of the G5422TG-12 via an amplifier without making any compromise with regard to timbre.</p><h3> Bound thinline double-cutaway body </h3><p>The body has been shaped to that of a thinline hollowbody profile, which marries comfortability and tonal versatility beautifully. The 5-ply maple tonewood works harmoniously with the body profile to generate a confident midrange energy that has a softly rounded low end and sparkling brilliance across the upper frequencies.</p><p></p>As well as ensuring the timbre of the G5422TG-12 is second to none, the team at Gretsch have gone to great lengths to resurrect the vintage aesthetic of their historic models, whilst appointing modern touches to maintain a solid and stable playing feel. The body top incorporates stylish over-sized bound f-holes, which allow the timbre to ease through for a smooth yet subtle acoustic projection. The top is bound to offer protection to the edges and complement the finish. Protection is offered to the paintwork in the form of a slender yet resilient gloss finish. A gold plexi pickguard, complete with black Gretsch logo, resides just beneath the pickups to prevent unwanted nicks and scrapes from affecting the lower bout.<p></p><h3> Gloss-finished maple neck </h3><p>Joined to the body is a fast-playing, gloss-finished maple neck, which is shaped to a """"U""""-shape profile to create a comfortable feel in the hand. Paired with the neck is a 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which has been bound to guarantee seamless transitions between frets that are adorned with pearloid hump-block position inlays. The 12-inch fingerboard radius makes executing string bends are breeze, whilst the double-cutaway body profile means that each and every fret is within easy reach.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck you'll find a Graph Tech nubone nut, which works in partnership with the vintage-style open-back tuning machines to stabilise string tension and tuning integrity. Connected to the body is a smaller late-'50s G6120 bound headstock, which proudly shows off a white Gretsch logo. Fitted to the G5422TG-12 is an adjusto-matic bridge with a secured rosewood-base, which is paired with a Gretshc G-Cutout tailpiece. The hardware creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3> Blacktop Filter'Tron pickups </h3><p>Fitted to the body are two BlackTop Filter'Tron humbuckers in the neck and bridge positions. Designed to enhance the """"fat"""" timbre produced by the body, this pair produce an enviable tonal arsenal for you to play with. The neck position enhances the plucky articulation of the neck and fingerboard, whilst the bridge pickup draws more from the body, generating a thunderous charge when you want it.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of a three-way pickup selector toggle switch, which allows you to select either pickup independently or select both outputs simultaneously for a fuller tone. Each pickup has an independent volume knob, and both are connected to master volume and tone pots.</p><p>The Gretsch G5422TG-12 Electromatic hollowbody guitar is the perfect model for those who want the sparkling majesty of a 12-string in a model that is very comfortable to perform with, and offers a highly versatile tonal palette to paint with. Whether you're picking up your first model, or are a seasoned pro who is seeking a reliable touring partner, it doesn't get much better than this.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gretsch Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,641-641-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/c1caf8bb19dfab38a09ffc2ae89565c4.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"G5422TG-12 12-String Electromatic Hollowbody Guitar","G5422TG-12 12-String Electromatic Hollowbody Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

However, this stripped back affair is just as much guts as it is glory, and perfect for those who want an affordable model to hit the stage with, whilst still retaining that classic Gibson look and feel.</p><h3>Classic design without frills</h3><p>At the heart of this model is the same classic tonewood setup that has been the driving force of the Les Paul's tone for decades - a solid mahogany body with a crisp maple top to supply an exquisite balance of power and precision. To increase playing comfort, the body has been treated to modern weight relief, which takes the back-breaking labour out of every performance, without compromising on that sumptuous Les Paul tone. As previously stated, the faded look may offer a less polished finish than that of pricier models, but it is in no way less eye catching. With a healthy lacquer to finish the job, you can rest assured that it will outshine all its rivals for years to come.</p><h3> Sturdy and responsive neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid maple neck, which has been treated to a slim taper profile to lend its support in creating the most comfortable playing experience. Married to the body is a sublime rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with dot position inlays to aid in your navigation. The single-cutaway body profile allows you to reach the upper frets with ease.</p><p>At the top of the neck you'll find the headstock, which is equipped with vintage-style keystone tuners to uphold tuning integrity with precision. The partnership of tuners and Tektoid nut stabilises string tension to maintain the playing feel across each string throughout even the most energetic of performances. Fitted to the body is an aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with steel thumbwheels, as well as an aluminium stop bar tailpiece with steel posts. The bridge and tailpiece work together harmoniously to optimise intonation and sustain by creating a seamless connection between strings and body.</p><h3>Upgraded electronics</h3><p>The Gibson Les Paul Faded T Electric Guitar is fitted with an impressive pickup pairing that includes a 490R in the neck position, and a 490T in the bridge position. Control over the pickups comes via independent volume and tone pots for each pickup, as well as a three-way selector switch. The range of tonal colours you have to paint with is astonishing, with murky muddy, fat saturated lows to impeccably polished highs that sing. Whatever style of music you are tackling, the Les Paul Faded T is more than capable of exceeding your expectations.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>To complete the package, the Gibson Les Paul Faded T Electric Guitar is supplied with a padded gig bag to protect your new pride and joy, as well as get you out on the road asap. Each model also comes with a strap and polishing cloth, to help keep your new guitar in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,537-537-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/617d6cd4cee79d21ab21a7190118759f.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Les Paul Faded T Electric Guitar - Worn Brown","Gibson Les Paul Faded T Electric Guitar - Worn Brown",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

For nearly two hundred years, Martin have honed their instrument-building skills, and as you'd expect from a company who pioneered the dreadnought guitar, X-bracing and the 14-fret model, it is only fair to say that the modern acoustic guitar would not exist in the form that it does without their developments.</p><p>The back and sides of the guitar are built from solid East Indian rosewood, which produces a warmth that is infused with a stability that enables it to produce deep, rich tones. Not only that but it looks absolutely gorgeous too. The HD-28 has a driving mid to low-end energy that produces a forceful punch.

The bone nut maintains string tension keenly, whilst the solid black ebony bridge provides a seamless connection between the strings and body for optimum intonation.</p><h3>Finish</h3><p>The body is bound by a white boltaron, which encases the stunning natural finish in style. Protection has been given to the woods in the form of polished gloss to the top, back and sides. Martin has developed their own unique recipe to guarantee the woods are protected from unwanted damage, temperature/humidity changes, without impeding the woods ability to resonate to their fullest.</p><p>The Martin HD-28 dreadnought acoustic guitar is quite simply one of the finest acoustic guitar models available, built by a company who have been crating impeccable acoustic guitars since 1833.

The new 114ce has a Grand Auditorium profile with a slick Venetian cutaway. Built using excellent quality materials, the 114ce is a sublime acoustic that responds to all styles of play making it a genuine all-rounder to have in your collection.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>The Grand Auditorium body shape was first introduced in 1994 and has remained a top choice for many musicians because it is so incredibly multifaceted. The 114ce also has a Venetian cutaway, offering not just a sleek appearance but this slope in the body provides full access to the neck.</p><p>Sitka Spruce is nearly always the choice of tonewood when it comes to making a Taylor acoustic, and this remains true in the 114ce. The top is reinforced with forward shifted pattern bracing which helps the guitar to sing with clarity and volume. The back and sides of the 114ce are made up of layered walnut, an exquisite tonewood which produces a versatile tonal range with deep lows, a punchy midrange and crisp highs.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>You can be sure that the 114ce feels just great to play thanks to the Taylor patented sapele neck. The neck has a narrower 1 11/16 inch nut width, facilitating those big bar chords and faster playing methods. The neck is topped with an ebony fingerboard which is home to 20 frets, and of course you have full access to these thanks to the body's Venetian cutaway. Each fret transition is guided by the 4mm dot Italian acrylic inlays.</p><h3>ES2 Pickup</h3><p>The natural voice of the 114ce acoustic is transferred beautifully via the onboard Expression System 2 pickup. This pickup is like no other due to its unique positioning behind the saddle. It features three individually calibrated sensors, and their placement means that each note played can be accurately and clearly heard. The pickup and Taylor's custom-designed """"professional audio""""-grade preamp work together to give the 114ce its phenomenal acoustic tones. Amend your sound to suit your playing needs using the simple controls for Tone and Volume.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>The Taylor 114ce offers tuning stability you can rely on thanks to the chrome tuners fitted to the headstock. The Tusq nut and Micarta saddle also work with the tuners to provide durability and enhanced sustain.</p><p>The neat, natural finish of the body come with matching slick appointments consisting of a three-ring soundhole rosette, black pickguard and black binding. Carrying the 114ce is made easy as Taylor include a lightweight protective gig bag with each one.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1022-1022-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/e1054acdf3fa27b69faf5d517cb0d733.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 2017 114ce Walnut Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 2017 114ce Walnut Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

However, this stripped back affair is just as much guts as it is glory, and perfect for those who want an affordable model to hit the stage with, whilst still retaining that classic Gibson look and feel.</p><h3>Classic design without frills</h3><p>At the heart of this model is the same classic tonewood setup that has been the driving force of the Les Paul's tone for decades - a solid mahogany body with a crisp maple top to supply an exquisite balance of power and precision. To increase playing comfort, the body has been treated to modern weight relief, which takes the back-breaking labour out of every performance, without compromising on that sumptuous Les Paul tone. As previously stated, the faded look may offer a less polished finish than that of pricier models, but it is in no way less eye catching. With a healthy lacquer to finish the job, you can rest assured that it will outshine all its rivals for years to come.</p><h3> Sturdy and responsive neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid maple neck, which has been treated to a slim taper profile to lend its support in creating the most comfortable playing experience. Married to the body is a sublime rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with dot position inlays to aid in your navigation. The single-cutaway body profile allows you to reach the upper frets with ease.</p><p>At the top of the neck you'll find the headstock, which is equipped with vintage-style keystone tuners to uphold tuning integrity with precision. The partnership of tuners and Tektoid nut stabilises string tension to maintain the playing feel across each string throughout even the most energetic of performances. Fitted to the body is an aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with steel thumbwheels, as well as an aluminium stop bar tailpiece with steel posts. The bridge and tailpiece work together harmoniously to optimise intonation and sustain by creating a seamless connection between strings and body.</p><h3>Upgraded electronics</h3><p>The Gibson Les Paul Faded T Electric Guitar is fitted with an impressive pickup pairing that includes a 490R in the neck position, and a 490T in the bridge position. Control over the pickups comes via independent volume and tone pots for each pickup, as well as a three-way selector switch. The range of tonal colours you have to paint with is astonishing, with murky muddy, fat saturated lows to impeccably polished highs that sing. Whatever style of music you are tackling, the Les Paul Faded T is more than capable of exceeding your expectations.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>To complete the package, the Gibson Les Paul Faded T Electric Guitar is supplied with a padded gig bag to protect your new pride and joy, as well as get you out on the road asap. Each model also comes with a strap and polishing cloth, to help keep your new guitar in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,528-528-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/7f55340c182cadef0202f6bce01d054d.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Les Paul Faded T Electric Guitar - Worn Cherry","Gibson Les Paul Faded T Electric Guitar - Worn Cherry",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The deep D neck profile guarantees a reassuringly substantial feel in the hand without becoming cumbersome or unwieldy. Paired with the neck is a cool rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 20-frets that bow to a graceful 12-inch radius to produce the smoothest of playing surfaces. The gloss urethane finish prevents unwanted wear and tear from affecting the playability of the neck.</p><h3>Comfortable single-cutaway body</h3><p>The body is built using basswood, a lightweight and tonally versatile wood that is perfect as the partner to the short-scale neck design.

If playing guitar was a guilty pleasure, then the Explorer would make the ultimate indulgence. Fortunately, we don't need to excuse ourselves for wanting a piece of this beauty. Each model is supplied with a hardshell case and accessory kit from Gibson, so you can transport yours in safety and keep it in top condition as you go. Don't hang about, do yourself a favour and grab yours now!</p><h3>Striking body style</h3><p>Ever since its introduction, the Explorer has forged its own path. The angular shape is a far cry from the rounder-bodied guitars in the Gibson family, and though it was initially released several decades ago, it is still light years ahead of the rest. The body is crafted using mahogany, a solid tonewood that is highly regarded due to its impressive midrange clout and enduring sustain. The weight across the body and neck is finely balanced to create a comfortable feel in the hands, making it an effortless guitar to perform with.</p><p>The sublime antique natural finish is protected by a coating of gloss nitrocellulose lacquer, preserving the tonewood for as long as possible so that it can age gracefully.</p><h3>Solid and fast-playing neck</h3><p>The set-in mahogany neck is firmly joined to the body of the Explorer, equipping it with a reassuringly unyielding feel in the hand. The neck is shaped to the slimtaper profile to add speed and dexterity to its arsenal. Married to the neck is a torrefied granadillo fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are decorated with acrylic dot position inlays for guidance. The neck also features a Tektoid nut which lubricates itself, consequently improving sustain and ensuring accuracy when returning to pitch.</p><p>The body shape and neck profile partnership comes together beautifully to ensure that your fretting hand has access to each fret, affording total mastery the fingerboard. The result is a playing experience unlike any other.</p><h3>Mighty BurstBuckers</h3><p>To give the 2018 Explorer the tonal palette it deserves, Gibson USA have fitted a pair of their BurstBucker pickups, with a 2 in the neck position, and a 3 in the bridge position. Both pickups are modelled on the hallowed PAF pickups. However, the BurstBucker 3 has been overwound, which is essence gives it a much beefier and hotter output. Control over the pickups comes in the form of independent volume controls, a master tone that controls both, and a three-way pickup selector switch. The range of tones available to allows the Explorer to tackle any musical genre with ease. Dial it back for a smoother, less in-your-face response. Alternatively, ramp up the level, push your amp, and let loose some punishing riffs.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The headstock is fitted with the highly-reliable Mini Grover Kidney tuners that boast a 14:01 gear ratio, you can rest assured that your strings will stay in tune no matter what. The body is home to an aluminium Tune-O-Matic bridge, which is partnered with an aluminium stopbar tailpiece to provide the perfect anchor point for the strings to optimise intonation and sustain throughout every performance.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,564-564-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/62b097314c40ded9a452b387e3e6b466.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson USA 2018 Explorer Electric Guitar - Antique Natural","Gibson USA 2018 Explorer Electric Guitar - Antique Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Delivering the lush tonal complexity of a hollowbody with the classic chime and jangle that comes with the increased string count, Gretsch has created a breath-taking model that is equally at home in the studio and on the stage. Packed with a pair of Blacktop Filter'Tron pickups, you can play the mesmerising timbre of the G5422TG-12 via an amplifier without making any compromise with regard to timbre.</p><h3> Bound thinline double-cutaway body </h3><p>The body has been shaped to that of a thinline hollowbody profile, which marries comfortability and tonal versatility beautifully. The 5-ply maple tonewood works harmoniously with the body profile to generate a confident midrange energy that has a softly rounded low end and sparkling brilliance across the upper frequencies.</p><p></p>As well as ensuring the timbre of the G5422TG-12 is second to none, the team at Gretsch have gone to great lengths to resurrect the vintage aesthetic of their historic models, whilst appointing modern touches to maintain a solid and stable playing feel. The body top incorporates stylish over-sized bound f-holes, which allow the timbre to ease through for a smooth yet subtle acoustic projection. The top is bound to offer protection to the edges and complement the finish. Protection is offered to the paintwork in the form of a slender yet resilient gloss finish. A gold plexi pickguard, complete with black Gretsch logo, resides just beneath the pickups to prevent unwanted nicks and scrapes from affecting the lower bout.<p></p><h3> Gloss-finished maple neck </h3><p>Joined to the body is a fast-playing, gloss-finished maple neck, which is shaped to a """"U""""-shape profile to create a comfortable feel in the hand. Paired with the neck is a 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which has been bound to guarantee seamless transitions between frets that are adorned with pearloid hump-block position inlays. The 12-inch fingerboard radius makes executing string bends are breeze, whilst the double-cutaway body profile means that each and every fret is within easy reach.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck you'll find a Graph Tech nubone nut, which works in partnership with the vintage-style open-back tuning machines to stabilise string tension and tuning integrity. Connected to the body is a smaller late-'50s G6120 bound headstock, which proudly shows off a white Gretsch logo. Fitted to the G5422TG-12 is an adjusto-matic bridge with a secured rosewood-base, which is paired with a Gretshc G-Cutout tailpiece. The hardware creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3> Blacktop Filter'Tron pickups </h3><p>Fitted to the body are two BlackTop Filter'Tron humbuckers in the neck and bridge positions. Designed to enhance the """"fat"""" timbre produced by the body, this pair produce an enviable tonal arsenal for you to play with. The neck position enhances the plucky articulation of the neck and fingerboard, whilst the bridge pickup draws more from the body, generating a thunderous charge when you want it.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of a three-way pickup selector toggle switch, which allows you to select either pickup independently or select both outputs simultaneously for a fuller tone. Each pickup has an independent volume knob, and both are connected to master volume and tone pots.</p><p>The Gretsch G5422TG-12 Electromatic hollowbody guitar is the perfect model for those who want the sparkling majesty of a 12-string in a model that is very comfortable to perform with, and offers a highly versatile tonal palette to paint with. Whether you're picking up your first model, or are a seasoned pro who is seeking a reliable touring partner, it doesn't get much better than this.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gretsch Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,637-637-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/116644b47b23a58401edae097403bfde.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"G5422TG-12 12-String Electromatic Hollowbody - Black","G5422TG-12 12-String Electromatic Hollowbody - Black",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The S series of Ibanez guitars are incredibly well-designed, and the S670QM is just that. With its sculpted double cutaway body and a lightweight but sturdy build, the S670QM feels and sounds dreamy.</p> <h3>Body</h3> <p>As mentioned, the S670QM is shaped to the deep double cutaway shape which opens up access to the neck in its entirety. The body of the guitar sits well against the player, while its lightweight feel reduces fatigue onstage. The body is constructed from mahogany, producing rich, warm tones with clarity. Plus, the body features a quilted maple top that shines radiantly through the eye-catching finish.</p> <h3>Neck</h3> <p>The S670QM is fitted with a smooth maple neck which features the signature Ibanez Wizard III profile. The Wizard III neck is thin and flat which promotes faster playability. A bound rosewood fingerboard tops the neck which feels just right in the hand, facilitating grip and fret transitioning. The fingerboard hosts 24 frets, meaning you have a two-octave fretboard to explore fully. Offset white dot inlays decorate the frets to guide you along.</p> <h3>Quantum Pickups</h3> <p>The S670QM Spot Run is powered by a superb trio of Quantum pickups. The neck and bridge positions feature ceramic humbucking Quantum pickups, while the middle position employs an Alnico-powered Quantum single-coil pickup. The fusion of humbuckers and a single-coil pickup opens up a whole universe of tones, whether you're tearing out solos or using their responsive bass / midrange tones for complex chording.</p> <p>Master Volume and Tone controls allow you to shape your sound with precision, while a 5-way pickup switch blends and separates the pickups.</p> <h3>Hardware and Finish</h3> <p>The S670QM is fitted with an excellent Edge-Zero II tremolo bridge with a stud lock function that improves tuning stability even after plenty of heavy tremolo use. The tuners at the headstock also work alongside the bridge to ensure that each string remains in tune.</p> <p>The spectacular finish of this Spot Run model is matched up with Cosmo Black hardware.

The limited-edition model features an exclusive green Anaconda Burst finish, which accentuates the two-piece figured maple top beautifully. As one of a very limited number of models to be numbered and signed by Slash, you can rest assured that you are getting a truly unique addition to your collection.</p><h3> Classic Les Paul design </h3><p>As one might expect, the Gibson Custom Slash Les Paul adheres strictly to the traditional Les Paul body design, which has laid the foundation of Slash's tone for decades. The body is built using lightweight solid mahogany, which establishes a rich and warm foundation. As noted above, the top is crafted from two-piece figured maple, which ensures that the mid to high notes ring out with the utmost clarity. The heavenly Anaconda Burst finish is protected by a layer of nitrocellulose lacquer, to maintain its pristine condition for many years to come.</p><h3> Sturdy yet supple neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid mahogany neck, which is connected via a long tenon joint for improved sustain, and reinforced using a hide glue fit. The neck is shaped to a custom Slash taper, with a .910-inch depth at the 1st fret extending to a 1.05-inch depth at the 12th fret. No introduction need be made with regard to Slash's mastery of the guitar, but suffice it to say that if his own custom profile is good enough for him, it is good enough for the rest of us.</p><h3> Fast and free fingerboard </h3><p>Paired with the neck is a luxurious rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. Thanks to the customary single-cutaway body profile of the Les Paul, every fret is within easy reach so that you can comfortably noodle your way to the highest reaches of the fingerboard. Binding guarantees that seamless transition between frets are the norm, removing unwanted obstacles to maximise that lightning fast playing feel.</p><h3> Slash Signature Seymour Duncan pickups </h3><p>It is only fitting that the Gibson Custom Slash Les Paul be equipped with Slash's Signature Seymour Duncan APH-1 and APH-2 pickups. Since the recording of the seminal Guns N' Roses' album """"Appetite for Destruction"""", Slash has favoured the APH-1, with Seymour Duncan creating the APH-2 in its visage. The intensity of Slash's playing style is magnified when these pickups are cranked, but also retain a subtlety when rolled back during more intimate moments. Control over the pickups comes in the form of 500K CTS Volume and Tone pots, with hand-wired harness that feature Sprague Orange Drop capacitors, so that no matter how minor the attenuation, you have the smoothest of control with absolute precision. A Switchcraft toggle switch affords the same level of precision when changing between the bridge and neck pickups.</p><h3> Immaculate hardware </h3><p>The body is home to a nickel-finished lightweight aluminium ABR-1 bridge, which creates a seamless transition between strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain.

The Axcess Standard adheres closely to the solidbody brilliance of the LP, but makes it even more of a joy to wield thanks to an improved neck heel design. The inclusion of the enigmatic Floyd Rose tremolo offers peerless vibrato control. Put it all together, and you've got a pro-level guitar that is destined for greatness.</p><h3> Maple and mahogany partnership</h3><p>A dominant feature often found in Les Paul guitars is the combination of maple and mahogany in the body. The Les Paul Axcess Standard has a carved maple top, which is finished in a glorious Iced Tea that is protected by a slender layer of gloss. Paired with the maple top is a solid mahogany body, which establishes a firm, resounding midrange timbre. Modern weight-relief has been employed to take the heavy feel out of the guitar, giving you the best of both worlds - unrelenting sustain with a lightweight playing feel. Whether you're laying down licks in the studio or wowing your adoring fans on the stage, you can do it in style without the back ache.</p><h3>Solid mahogany neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid mahogany neck, which is shaped to a rounded profile that extends to a contoured rib-cage heel cut. The heel design enables the body of the guitar to rest snugly against you for increased playing comfort. Married to the neck is a heavenly 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which offers a wonderful playground for your fingers to explore. As always, the sleek single-cutaway design affords easier access to the upper frets to give you total mastery over the fingerboard.</p><h3>Beautiful 496R AND 498T pickups</h3><p>The 496R and 498T pickups are a pair of hot humbuckers which really help your tone shine through this solidbody electric guitar. They are powerful and energetic pickups which have incredible sustain and a lot of bite that can add definition to your sound. The pickups are wax-potted to completely reduce any possible feedback and both pickups allow you to play anything from bright, clean tones to crunchy rock.</p><p>Individual volume and tone controls for each pickup allow you to shape and carve out your tone to perfection, whilst a three-way pickup selector switch enables you to choose either independently or both simultaneously. Whether you're performing fat and thick bluesy numbers, tight and articulate jazz, or in your face rock and metal, the Les Paul Axcess Standard is equipped to do it all.</p><h3>Hardware and finish</h3><p>The Les Paul Axcess Standard is fitted with a Floyd Rose tremolo bridge and tailpiece with an R4 locking nut, which allows you to dive and wail to your heart's content. The sturdiness of this design is truly remarkable, and you can rest assured that no matter how much abuse you give it, the bridge and tailpiece will bounce back in style every time.</p><p>The Gibson Les Paul Axcess Standard is a breath-taking model which brings together a partnership of traditional features and modern upgrades to bring the Les Paul guitar right up to scratch in our present day. To keep the Axcess protected and in as good as new condition, Gibson supply a hardshell case with every model, as well as a certificate of authenticity.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,531-531-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/1fd291905305b2fe5129b8c18b56a7d8.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Les Paul Axcess Standard Floyd Rose Electric Guitar - Iced Tea","Gibson Les Paul Axcess Standard Floyd Rose Electric Guitar - Iced Tea",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

It is built using tonewoods of the highest quality and plays host to a wealth of beautiful finishing touches.</p><p></p><p>The Taylor 320 has been built with a dreadnought body shape, which is noted for its ability to project a powerful sound. It responds well over a wide dynamic range, boosting the signal of gentler players and yielding a high quality of articulation to more aggressive strummers and pickers. This makes the dreadnought shape perfect for big hitters who want a guitar that will accentuate their sound, rather than drown it out.</p><p>The top wood is built using Solid Tropical Mahogany, a dense tonewood that delivers a very bright and punchy sound. The Mahogany top gives a short and snappy tone to the guitar but throughout its life can develop into an incredibly warm and natural soundboard. It is well suited to players who are looking for a tone with plenty of individuality and attitude. The top is reinforced with forward-shifted bracing that features Taylor's patented relief rout. The relief rout allows the stiff mahogany to resonate with greater flexibility, without sacrificing structural integrity. Therefore, the 320 can produce huge amounts of sound when required.</p><p>The back and side wood of the 320 is built using West African Sapele wood, which has been utilised by Taylor for over a decade. Sapele is known for having similar harmonic qualities to mahogany in delivering soothing lows and warm mid tones. It is a very-adaptable tonewood that supports a variety of styles from fingerstyle to strumming.</p><p>The combination of the mahogany top and sapele back and sides creates a guitar with a high degree of low-end depth that is matched with a bright and snappy upper midrange. The body is bound in black to protect the edges from chips and damage. A black pickguard protect the top of the body beneath the strings.</p><p>The neck is constructed from reassuringly unyielding Tropical Mahogany, which is set to a 25-1/2"""" scale length. Coupled with an Ebony fingerboard - that is home to 20 frets - the sonic properties of both woods marry together beautifully to complete the delivery of superbly resonant tones with the softened mid range.</p><p>The strings are held in tune by Taylor's reliable chrome tuners, and meet the body via the Tusq nut and saddle who both ensure string action integrity is acutely maintained.</p><p>The Taylor 320 top, back, sides and neck are all protected with a satin finish. This is durable enough to withstand minor scratches and scrapes whilst remaining thin enough to allow the wood to resonate without being impeded. The headstock overlay is fashioned from Indian Rosewood.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1067-1067-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/9539844c62375baf187069ef123d5ea8.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 320 Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 320 Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The 816e electro-acoustic guitar is a perfect example of what they're capable of; combining superb tonewoods, solid build quality and an electronics system that compliments the timbre of the guitar excellently, to create a sublime instrument that is studio and stage ready. The 816e is shaped to the Grand Symphony body, serving up a powerful acoustic voice thanks to its wide wait and larger lower bout. If you're a player that prefers to strum or pick their guitar with vigour, but don't want to compromise on sound quality or articulation, then the Grand Symphony body is perfect. Even fingerstyle players will appreciate the dynamic range offered by this shape, as deft finger picking is represented well with wonderfully lush tones.</p><p>The Taylor 816e body back and sides have been crafted from Indian Rosewood, a delightfully rich and complex tonewood that produces a full and robust mid to low-end force. The top is made from Sitka Spruce - a Taylor favourite - due to its excellent resonant properties that allow it to project huge sounds with the greatest of ease. The bright-sounding Spruce works wonderfully with the Rosewood and body shape to create an incredibly complex tonal palette.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>The body has been given a gloss finish to protect from unwanted nicks and scrapes that come through playing. It also enables the guitar to cope with changes in humidity and temperature capably, making this a fantastic touring and gigging partner.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>The neck is made from Tropical Mahogany, given it a reassuringly sturdy feel in the hand. Married to the Mahogany is a sumptuous Ebony fingerboard, giving a delightfully playable surface to navigate along. The Mahogany and Ebony combine perfectly to create a highly resonant platform for the strings, guaranteeing that every note rings out with the utmost clarity. The neck has been treated with a satin finish to give it a smooth playing feel, even after hours on stage.</p><h3>Electronics</h3><p>The 816e electro-benefits from Taylor's newly designed Expression System 2 (ES2), their behind-the-saddle pickup and custom-designed """"professional-audio""""-grade preamp. As part of their never-ending quest for better tone, they shifted their usual 'under-the-saddle' design as they found that by placing the pickup behind-the-saddle, a less brittle, brash and synthetic sound could be captured. This means that no matter how aggressively you play, the natural warmth produced by the tonewoods rings out beautifully.</p><p>The control layout features the same volume and tone control knobs as on the original Expression System, with Taylor changing the gain structure of the preamp slightly to make it a little hotter. When playing live, this subtle adjustment gives the 816e the boost you need to be heard loud and clear.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>High-quality hardware is used throughout to ensure a professional-level finish is achieved. Taylor nickel tuners work in partnership with the Tusq nut and Miscarta saddle to ensure tuning integrity, string tension and the string's connection to the body is perfectly maintained. A Maple .080"""" binding, which also enhances the stunning natural grain of the tonewoods, protects the body edges.</p><p>The impressive Taylor 816e also comes with its very own Taylor Deluxe Hardshell Brown case, perfect for transporting this beauty between your home, the studio and to gigs. If you're looking for a fantastic all-rounder that can produce enormous tones, then this is the partner for you!</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1091-1091-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/b36b4e15e506429ef629a9f27625e695.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 816e Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 816e Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Though it has long been associated with hard rock and metal, it is a much more versatile instrument that is well suited to a wide range of other styles from jazz to blues, prog and grunge. The 2017 HP (High Performance) model is endowed with a selection of premium appointments that makes this the perfect choice for professionals who want a powerful workhorse that is built for life on the road.</p><h3>The Flying V</h3><p>Just looking at the Flying V, it becomes immediately clear as to where its name comes from. Multi-cut mahogany has been employed as the body tonewood, giving the V a commanding mid to low-end energy. Though it comes in at under 4lbs, the guitar produces an enduring sustain. As with other models in the 2017 range, Gibson has increased the comfortability of the guitar by including a sculpted fast-access heel. This accompanies a flat carve body contour and makes it even more enjoyable to wield.</p><h3>Slimtaper Flying V profile</h3><p>Securely fitted to the V-shape body - via a traditional Mortis and Tenon joint with Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive reinforcement - is a single-piece mahogany neck. Shaped to the Flying V slimtaper profile, Gibson have designed this neck with soloists in mind to be a fast and smooth playing dream. Married to the neck is a 22-fret grenadillo fingerboard, which is decorated with Mother-of-Pearl dot inlays to conduct your way up and down the frets with confidence.</p><p>At the top of the neck is an innovative titanium zero-fret adjustable nut, which couples exceptional sustain with outstanding resonance for a rich, full-bodied tone. The zero-fret nut also gives the neck and strings the fastest action to date, perfect for rock guitarists who play at break-neck speeds.</p><h3>Dirty Finger+ pickups</h3><p>The Dirty Fingers+ humbuckers are Ceramic magnet-powered high gain monsters that deliver searing tones to die for. These beauties are perfect for taking centre stage, with a loud and aggressive edge that pushes amps hard - making them a fantastic partner for your tube/valve amp. Beefing up the sustain generated by the body/neck combo, the Dirty Fingers+ sing with absolute clarity.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of newly designed knurled knobs, with added grip to ensure greater precision when making tonal adjustments during energetic sets.</p><h3> Improved G-FORCE auto-tuning </h3><p>Gibson has equipped the 2017 Flying V HP with an updated version of their G-FORCE auto-tuning system. This sits at the back of the headstock, and gives you access to alternate tunings and adjustment with greater speed and accuracy. The improved synchronized spur gear system operates smoothly and quietly, and boasts a highly impressive 40:01 gear ratio - you can rest assured that once your tuning is set, it will remain that way no matter how hard you rock out.</p><h3>Stage-ready hardware</h3><p>The Gibson 2017 Flying V HP is fitted with a chrome-plated Tune-o-Matic bridge with titanium saddles and locking thumbwheels, which is paired with a chrome-plated aluminium stopbar tailpiece with locking studs. The titanium saddles further enhance the sustain and helps to produce a crystal clear, bright sound.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>Each Gibson 2017 Flying V HP Electric Guitar model is supplied with a hardshell case in aluminium to protect your pride and joy whether it is in storage or in transit. With the 2017 model you will also receive a Gibson USA multi tool, premium strap, polishing cloth, and owner's manual to help you to keep your Flying V in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,441-441-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/b67b0ec545a30b30105bb7fb6d30faf1.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 Flying V HP Electric Guitar","Gibson 2017 Flying V HP Electric Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Whatever style of music you're tackling, the 2017 EB Bass is a mighty performance partner for both amateur and professional players alike.</p><h3> Sophisticated EB profile </h3><p>Swamp ash is the tonewood of choice, and is perfect as the driving power behind the EB Bass. Highly regarded thanks to its rich warmth and depth of tone, Swamp Ash also boasts a relatively lightweight feel along with its big-hearted tone. The body is treated to a deep double-cutaway profile, making easy to reach the upper frets in comfort. The body has a contoured edge, which creates a comfortable rest for the picking arm, and allows the body to sit snugly against your body during performances.</p><h3> Robust rounded neck </h3><p>The neck is crafted using maple, which is shaped to a rounded profile to offer a substantial feel in the hand. Maple offers a bright counterpoint to the swamp ash to offer articulation across each and every note. Married to the neck is a sumptuous rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 24 frets that are adorned with dot position inlays to guide your way in style. The generous 34-inch scale length of the neck is paired with a 12-inch fingerboard radius, laying the foundation for an accommodating playing surface for your fingers to explore.</p><h3> EB Rhythm and Lead Humbuckers </h3><p>With a tone wood combo as potent as this, some equally powerful pickups are in order. Two Alnico V magnet-powered humbuckers are equipped, which deliver a high-gain output with fat tone. Each of these has its own volume control, so that tones can be blended from each pickup, whilst a master tone pot allows you to embellish output from low to high frequencies.</p><h3> Stage-ready hardware </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a Babicz full-contact bridge, which creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain. The headstock is home to Grover tuners which provide stability throughout the most energetic of performances with a durable 20:01 tuning ratio. The newly appointed self-lubricating TekToid nut also works tirelessly to upheld sustain and pitch accuracy.</p><h3> Included Accessories </h3><p>The Gibson 2017 EB Bass 4 String T Bass Guitar is supplied with a Gibson EVF gig bag to protect your pride and joy at home and on the move. Along with the gig bag, each model is supplied with a Gibson USA guitar strap, polishing cloth, truss rod wench, and 2.5mm adjustment wrench to help you keep your EB Bass in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,414-414-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/0154a3587f2f83686682e634a0d0cc04.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 EB Bass 4 String T Bass Guitar - Natural Satin","Gibson 2017 EB Bass 4 String T Bass Guitar - Natural Satin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Delivering the lush tonal complexity of a hollowbody with the classic chime and jangle that comes with the increased string count, Gretsch has created a breath-taking model that is equally at home in the studio and on the stage. Packed with a pair of Blacktop Filter'Tron pickups, you can play the mesmerising timbre of the G5422TG-12 via an amplifier without making any compromise with regard to timbre.</p><h3> Bound thinline double-cutaway body </h3><p>The body has been shaped to that of a thinline hollowbody profile, which marries comfortability and tonal versatility beautifully. The 5-ply maple tonewood works harmoniously with the body profile to generate a confident midrange energy that has a softly rounded low end and sparkling brilliance across the upper frequencies.</p><p></p>As well as ensuring the timbre of the G5422TG-12 is second to none, the team at Gretsch have gone to great lengths to resurrect the vintage aesthetic of their historic models, whilst appointing modern touches to maintain a solid and stable playing feel. The body top incorporates stylish over-sized bound f-holes, which allow the timbre to ease through for a smooth yet subtle acoustic projection. The top is bound to offer protection to the edges and complement the finish. Protection is offered to the paintwork in the form of a slender yet resilient gloss finish. A gold plexi pickguard, complete with black Gretsch logo, resides just beneath the pickups to prevent unwanted nicks and scrapes from affecting the lower bout.<p></p><h3> Gloss-finished maple neck </h3><p>Joined to the body is a fast-playing, gloss-finished maple neck, which is shaped to a """"U""""-shape profile to create a comfortable feel in the hand. Paired with the neck is a 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which has been bound to guarantee seamless transitions between frets that are adorned with pearloid hump-block position inlays. The 12-inch fingerboard radius makes executing string bends are breeze, whilst the double-cutaway body profile means that each and every fret is within easy reach.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck you'll find a Graph Tech nubone nut, which works in partnership with the vintage-style open-back tuning machines to stabilise string tension and tuning integrity. Connected to the body is a smaller late-'50s G6120 bound headstock, which proudly shows off a white Gretsch logo. Fitted to the G5422TG-12 is an adjusto-matic bridge with a secured rosewood-base, which is paired with a Gretshc G-Cutout tailpiece. The hardware creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3> Blacktop Filter'Tron pickups </h3><p>Fitted to the body are two BlackTop Filter'Tron humbuckers in the neck and bridge positions. Designed to enhance the """"fat"""" timbre produced by the body, this pair produce an enviable tonal arsenal for you to play with. The neck position enhances the plucky articulation of the neck and fingerboard, whilst the bridge pickup draws more from the body, generating a thunderous charge when you want it.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of a three-way pickup selector toggle switch, which allows you to select either pickup independently or select both outputs simultaneously for a fuller tone. Each pickup has an independent volume knob, and both are connected to master volume and tone pots.</p><p>The Gretsch G5422TG-12 Electromatic hollowbody guitar is the perfect model for those who want the sparkling majesty of a 12-string in a model that is very comfortable to perform with, and offers a highly versatile tonal palette to paint with. Whether you're picking up your first model, or are a seasoned pro who is seeking a reliable touring partner, it doesn't get much better than this.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gretsch Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,639-639-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/3c3acf514d2f4604b560365061d87a81.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"G5422TG-12 12-String Electromatic Hollowbody - Walnut","G5422TG-12 12-String Electromatic Hollowbody - Walnut",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Adhering to the classic semi-hollowbody design, this legendary model is perfect for those who want their performance to truly shine.</p><h3>Sumptuous body design</h3><p>Since its release back in the late '50s, the ES-335 has found its way into the hands and hearts of players across many genres. Closely associated with blues, the ES-335 has been favoured by many rock players too, thanks to the innovative centre-block design that enables amplification without the unwanted noise or feedback. The body is constructed using 3-ply maple/poplar/maple for the top, back and sides, which creates a beautifully balanced tonal palette, as well as a lightweight feel in the hands. Spruce bracing ensures that the body top can resonate freely, whilst preventing buckling or warping from occurring over time.</p><h3>Supple yet supportive neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a heavenly maple neck, which is shaped to the rounded """"C"""" profile for a reassuringly comfortable grip. The rolled binding enables seamless transitions along the neck for a speedy playing feel. The neck is paired with a luxurious rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with pearloid dot position inlays to guide your way in style. For those who like to lay out their chops with a free-flowing feel, it doesn't get much more accommodating than with this setup.</p><h3>Burstbucker pickups</h3><p>Gibson has equipped the 2018 ES-335 Dot with Burstbucker pickups, which translate the lushly textured timbre of the guitar superbly when amplified. The acoustic response is captured in all its glory, whilst the pickups beg to be given an overdriven nudge to really bring out the best in this awesome guitar. Control comes in the form of independent volume and tone pots for each pickup, as well as a three-way pickup selector switch. Fat and bluesy to tight and articulate, these beauties are as versatile as they are powerful. The hand-wired electronics with ceramic capacitors ensure that any attenuation is done with absolute subtlety.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The body is equipped with an ABR-1 bridge that features plated brass saddles, which is paired with a die-cast zinc tailpiece. The result is a lightweight yet exceptionally strong and reliable system to uphold intonation and sustain across each and every string. The headstock is home to Grover 102 Rotomatic tuning machines, which maintain tuning with steadfast dedication. You can bend the strings to your heart's content, safe in the knowledge that they will keep coming back for more.</p><p>Each Gibson Memphis 2018 ES-335 Dot Electric Guitar is supplied with a hardcase to protect your model at home and on the go, as well as an accessory kit to help keep it in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,538-538-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/4b06674c50c0a9f105a1cb05d2b05f0e.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Memphis 2018 ES-335 Dot Electric Guitar - Wine Red","Gibson Memphis 2018 ES-335 Dot Electric Guitar - Wine Red",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

One of the first solidbody guitars became an overnight success much to Gibson's surprise, and this was the now renowned Firebird. This astonishing guitar was the brainchild of car designer Ray Dietrich who worked alongside Ted McCarty (the then Gibson President). With its unique shape derived from car tailfins, this new Gibson was a revolution, and the 2017 Traditional rendition keeps many of the original historic features with some added new and exclusive appointments.</p><h3>BODY</h3><p>Unlike guitars at the time of its birth in the early 1960s, the Firebird had a reverse-style body and a longer right horn, which it retains today. The neck-through-body is constructed from mahogany, a preferred tonewood for Gibson. The mahogany body feels lightweight and comfortable, reducing fatigue especially for performers and live musicians.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>As mentioned, the 2017 Firebird T has a neck-through-body construction, which boosts sustain and grants full access to all the frets, even the upper registers. The neck is made up of mahogany and walnut and shaped to the classic Firebird Slim Taper profile for a faster, more comfortable playing feel in the hand of a modern guitarist.</p><p>The neck is topped with a thicker rosewood fingerboard providing you with 22 frets to enjoy. The use of this thicker rosewood boosts tonal depth produced by the guitar for a high quality sound output. Gibson have fitted a Tektoid nut that is self-lubricating for a better return to pitch and improved sustain.</p><h3>ELECTRONICS</h3><p>The 2017 Firebird T is equipped with a pair of Mini Humbucker pickups, with one in the neck position and another in the bridge position. The original Firebirds were also fitted with this superb pickup duo, and the 2017 version will still deliver those PAF-style authentic Gibson tones.</p><p>Featuring the usual controls for rhythm and lead Volume and Tone and a 3-way toggle pickup switch, you can shape your tone to suit your playing needs. Each control has a black tophat with a silver insert, complementing the body finish.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The Firebird T headstock is directly fitted with the exceptional Steinberger Gearless tuning keys set to a 40:01:00 gear ratio. Their rare design and precise ratio ensure consistency in tuning each string as well as improving the overall sustain.</p><p>To further boost sustain and resonance there is a traditional chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge and an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece.</p><p>To protect and complement the body's smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer finish is a 3-ply white Firebird pickguard with the quintessential gold Firebird on it. To enable the guitarist to look after this wonderful guitar as best as possible, Gibson include a brown Firebird hardshell case, premium strap and polishing cloth.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,435-435-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/fb9aa505ad613e1b714e74170a2b4f40.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 Firebird T Electric Guitar","Gibson 2017 Firebird T Electric Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Now the guys at Gibson Custom have brought it back with historically accurate appointments to give you a reincarnation that is as close to the original as possible. This was one of the first Gibson sunburst models which has since become legendary and this new version brings it right up to date.</p><h3>MAPLE AND MAHOGANY</h3><p>In 1958 when Gibson first designed the original Les Paul Standard guitars, they would all feature a two-piece maple body top, and the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard indeed has a two-piece figured maple top. Figured maple is instantly eye-catching due to its flame-like texture while it also contributes to producing that vintage, '58 sound of the original.</p><p>The top is accompanied by mahogany in the back and sides which makes for the perfect partnership with the figured maple top to produce a strong, resonant output as authentic as those models which were first released in the late 50s. This version is given the 1950s style Les Paul body contour with no weight relief for a historically correct feel.</p><h3>VINTAGE CORRECT NECK</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard is fitted with a single-piece mahogany neck with a comfortable 1950's style Les Paul profile. It is firmly joined to the body using hot hide-glue which was a constitutional element of the original guitars. The neck also has a historic long-tenon neck joint which enables the guitar to precisely convey its classic tone.</p><p>Aboard the neck is a solid, one-piece Indian rosewood fingerboard which assists the mahogany in providing an all-round Les Paul sound. With 22 frets at your service, you can work your way up and down the neck in confidence thanks to the cellulose Trapezoid inlays.</p><h3>CUSTOM BUCKER PICKUPS</h3><p>Gibson have employed Custom Bucker pickups in the electronics of the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard, and consider them to be their best replica of PAF pickups yet. The Custom Buckers achieve an output that is as close to the original sound of a '58 guitar as you can imagine. Each pickup is powered by Alnico III magnets which deliver you a mix of epic ringing or deep rumble depending on the sound output that you require.</p><p>To help you control the rhythm and lead pickups, the guitar is fitted with two Volume and two Tone pots with matched 500k potentiometers and encased with gold top hats.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard has an ABR bridge with thumbwheels partnered with a lightweight aluminium stop bar tailpiece which enhances the overall intonation and sustain. At the top end of the guitar at the headstock we have reissue Kluson deluxe green keys made with nickel plated steel to uphold tuning integrity with accuracy.</p><p>Protecting the beautiful, hand-sprayed nitrocellulose finish on the body is a 1950's style cream pickguard which also really complements the guitar. The guitar also comes equipped with a reissue Les Paul case with a brown outer and pink fur lining to further protect this wonderful guitar.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,553-553-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/8adad7672c548fcebf6c36a8edf952a8.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Electric Guitar","Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Electric Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The body protected by a smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer, which preserves that natural grain and paintwork to allow your Les Paul to age gracefully. The 2018 Les Paul Classic also bypasses any weight relief system so you get the full rock-solid power and tone of the original.</p><h3>Single-piece mahogany neck</h3><p>To create a confident playing feel, Gibson have fitted a single-piece mahogany neck using a solid mortise and tenon joint reinforced using Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive.

The X Series combines excellent materials and techniques to design superb acoustic guitars that don't impact too heavily on your finances, making them more readily affordable for the majority of guitarists. The D12X1AE is an exquisite 12-string electro acoustic which has a full-bodied, warm sound that will completely fill the room.</p><h3>TOUGH DREADNOUGHT BODY</h3><p>The Martin D12X1AE is shaped to the customary dreadnought body profile which enables the 12 strings to vibrate freely offering an enhanced sustain and resonance as a result. This 12 string has a versatile tonal range with rich harmonics and a dynamic response. Martin have utilised a solid sitka spruce top to complement the body shape, and it is given extra tenacity by the A-Frame ''X-1'' bracing underneath.

The black richlite bridge holds a firm connection with the strings so you can play for hours with confidence.</p><p>An eye-catching tortoise pickguard sits beneath the soundhole to protect the body against scratches but also provides a stunning contrast against the hand-rubbed natural finish.</p><p>The Martin D12X1AE is an exceptional 12 string model full of high-caliber sound features and made with top quality materials for a comprehensive and comfortable feel.

The '57 Classic humbuckers are designed to accurately replicate the original PAF-style tone heard on the original SG models many years ago.</p><p>The controls follow suit on previous models, with four knobs for rhythm and lead Volume and Tone, plus a 3-way pickup toggle switch to shape your SG sound. With upgraded wiring for the 2017 model, the controls work brilliantly to offer the desired tone you're looking for. The chrome-plated knobs and switch tip are designed to improve grip, so even on a dark, hot stage you'll have no problem making adjustments.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>There is updated, modern chrome hardware featured on the SG Standard HP, from the bell-shaped truss rod cover, tuning keys, Gibson logo and crown on the headstock to the bridge, tailpiece and control knobs. The headstock is now fitted with an improved version of the G FORCE automatic tuning system. Retuning your strings is a doddle with this accurate system, plus it has been calibrated to prevent any unwanted noise or interference.</p><p>A traditional chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge is fitted to the lower bout of the body with titanium saddles joined by an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece with locking studs for top quality sustain and resonance.</p><p>The small teardrop pickguard is designed to both protect and complement the stunning finish of the SG Standard HP, while the white fingerboard binding on the neck also helps complete the look.

The team at Gibson Memphis have gone to great lengths to ensure that this model adheres to its traditional values, whilst providing today's players with everything they could desire to secure its legacy for years to come.</p><h3>Classic ES-330 body</h3><p>The top, back and sides are all constructed from 3-ply maple/poplar/maple, contributing to a rich and playful tonal palette from which to draw with. By using this 3-ply construction method, the body is afforded a lightweight feel, which makes it a joy to perform with. Whether you're tracking in the studio or taking to the stage, the 2018 ES-330 is the perfect playing partner. The body is equipped with spruce bracing to support the top, enabling it to resonate freely to deliver a power acoustic energy whilst preventing unwanted buckling from warping the top over time. The body has been finished in a gorgeous Sunset Burst, which is evocative of the classic era ES-330 models.</p><h3>Solid mahogany neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a quarter-sawn mahogany neck, which is shaped to the rounded """"C"""" profile to offer a reassuringly substantial feel in the hand. Married to the neck is a 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is home to pearloid small block inlays to guide you. The fingerboard has been treated with rolled binding to increase playing comfort and make transitions between frets as smooth as possible. The partnership between the neck and the fingerboard creates a playing feel that is the stuff dreams are made of.</p><h3>Versatile MHS P-90 pickups</h3><p>The Gibson 2018 ES-330 Hollowbody is home to a pair of Memphis Historic Spec P-90 pickups, which are modelled on those fitted in the original '50s models. The team at Gibson Memphis have gone to painstaking length to recreate the smooth output of the vintage P90s for the utmost articulation with an enviable warmth, resulting is a rich translation of the ES-330's acoustic timbre. Control over the pickups comes in the form of gold top hat knobs with hand-wired electronics and ceramic capacitors to guarantee the smoothest attenuation.</p><h3>Hardware and Finish</h3><p>Fitted to the body is an ABR bridge with updated titanium saddles to optimise performance. Paired with the bridge is a classic thinline trapeze tailpiece to complement the vintage aesthetic. The bridge and tailpiece partnership creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain. The headstock of this stunning model is fitted with vintage style tuners with oval buttons, which uphold tuning integrity with precision.</p><p>To complete this awesome package, the Gibson Memphis 2018 ES-330 Hollowbody Electric Guitar in Sunset Burst is supplied with a hardshell case and an accessory kit.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,554-554-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/e513b66e17fac0b8585a0c8ad5156ccc.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Memphis 2018 ES-330 Hollowbody Electric Guitar - Sunset Burst","Gibson Memphis 2018 ES-330 Hollowbody Electric Guitar - Sunset Burst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Gibson's Custom Shop team don't just create instruments, they create timeless works of art.</p><h3> Legendary Les Paul style </h3><p>The instantly recognisable single-cutaway Les Paul body profile combines power and elegance to perfection. The Custom Shop '59 Standard Historic model, is crafted using a single piece of hand-selected solid mahogany to lay the foundation for a thunderous energy that is infused with a penetrating warmth. Married to the body - using Franklin Titebond adhesive - is a heavenly two-piece book-matched flame maple top, which is bound in 50s' cream single-binding. The maple counters the dense mahogany by gently underpinning the low to mid-end clout, whilst introducing a softer upper-range with crispness and clarity.</p><p>The Custom Shop team has adopted the 1950s' style body contour to create a smooth and comfortable playing feel. Each model's finish is protected by a slender but resilient layer of nitrocellulose lacquer, which allows the wood to resonate unimpeded whilst shielding the beautiful grain from unwanted damage.</p><h3> Sturdy mahogany neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a single piece mahogany, which has been set using the historic long neck tenon and reinforced using hot hide glue for added strength. The long neck tenon joint is renowned for its superior sound transference, adding to the already impressive tones produced by this monster. Shaped to the '50s' profile with painstaking accuracy, the neck creates a substantial feel in the hand without becoming unwieldy.

The more you play this beauty, the more its character can develop and shine.</p><h3> Improved neck profile </h3><p>Fitted to the body via a classic mortis and tenon joint is the single piece mahogany neck, which is reinforced using Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive for a firm and reassuring playing feel. A newly applied asymmetrical slimtaper neck profile provides a fast and comfortable playing feel, which is tailored to meet the demands of today's versatile players.</p><p>Married to the neck is a heavenly 22-fret rosewood fingerboard with a compound-radius and rolled binding to heighten playing comfort, speed, and string-bending ability. Navigating the fingerboard is aided by the trapezoid inlays and side dot fret markers.</p><h3> Resilient, stage-ready hardware </h3><p>The TekToid nut guarantees a flush seat for each string to ensure great sustain. The headstock is home to Grover locking kidney tuning machines with an impressive 18:01 gear ratio, which uphold tuning integrity resolutely throughout each performance.</p><p>The body is home to the aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with titanium saddles and locking thumbwheels, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar with locking studs. The bridge and tailpiece partnership works dutifully to ensure intonation and sustain is optimised so that your Les Paul sings beautifully, and with the richness it deserves.</p><h3>Burstbucker Pro humbucker pickups</h3><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Standard T Electric Guitar has been treated to a pair of Burstbucker Pro Rhythm and Lead humbuckers, fitted in the neck and bridge positions respectively. The Burstbuckers produce the same glorious Gibson tones we all know and love, with a little added bite compared to their model T counterparts.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of new push-pull knurled knobs, which are finished in chrome to accentuate the stunning body finish. The switchable functions on offer are: to Tap or Split either pickup; activate an integrated High Pass Filter; or introduce transient suppression. The range of tones on offer is truly staggering, and you'll wonder how you ever got by without this guitar in your arsenal during any studio session or tour.Included Accessories</p><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Standard T Electric Guitar is supplied with its very own Gibson hardshell aluminium case with plush lined interior. Additional accessories include the Gibson USA multi-tool, premium strap, and polishing cloth to keep your new pride and joy in pristine working condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,465-465-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/8b421e0ae41d954baa67a52e134d9479.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 Les Paul Standard T Guitar - Honey Burst","Gibson 2017 Les Paul Standard T Guitar - Honey Burst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, you'll fall in love with this models comfortable playability, rich timbre, and versatile tonal offerings.</p><h3> Stylish Single-Cutaway </h3><p>The hollowbody is crafted using laminated maple, which resonates freely to generate a brilliant output with depth and power. Parallel tone bars are employed to reinforce the top, allowing it to vibrate freely to deliver a strong yet balanced timbre. As the wood is laminated, it holds up well with regard to changes in temperature and humidity, making it a fantastic gigging guitar thanks to its tonal consistency.</p><p></p>The body top is adorned with a pair of very stylish F-holes, which project the timbre with the utmost clarity.

Martin's innovation in the world of the humble acoustic guitar cannot be understated. As pioneers of the dreadnought guitar, X-bracing and the 14-fret guitar, it is only fair to say that the modern acoustic guitar would not exist in the form that it does without their developments, so for that Martin, we thank you.</p><p>The top is built from solid Sitka spruce, a fantastic North American tonewood that has the enviable combination of being lightweight whilst having exceptional resilience, strength and elasticity. Due to its superb resonant qualities, spruce enables the soundboard to project a big sound with ease. Thanks to the standard """"X"""" scalloped, forward shifted bracing pattern, the top is reinforced to prevent the chance of warping over time, but is able to resonate freely.</p><p>The back and sides of the guitar are built from genuine mahogany, the tonewood of choice in the manufacture of high-end acoustic guitars. Thanks to its natural warmth, the D-18 produces a rich, thumping mid to low-end energy that is the driving force of this acoustic's timbre.</p><p>The neck is cut to the modified low oval profile with performing artist taper to guarantee a reassuring feel in the hand without feeling cumbersome or bulky. Married to the neck is a solid black ebony fingerboard, which is home to a total of 20 frets, with 14 clear frets. Martin's """"old-style 18"""" position inlays provide a stylish navigational aid. The fingerboard width at the nut is 1-11/16"""" extending to 2-1/8"""" at the 12th fret. Although some fingerstyle players may prefer a 1-1/3"""" width at the nut, the guitar still accommodates fingerstyle beautifully.</p><p>The body top beneath the soundhole and along the lower bout is protected from pickscrapes that can occur during performances by a Delmar tortoise colour pickguard. The nickel open-geared tuning machines with butterbean knobs uphold tuning integrity with the utmost precision. The bone nut maintains string tension keenly, whilst the solid black ebony bridge provides a seamless connection between the strings and body for optimum intonation.</p><p>The body is bound by a tortoise colour trim, which encases the stunning natural finish in style. Protection has been given to the woods in the form of polished gloss with aging toner to the top, and polished gloss on the back and sides. Martin has developed their own unique recipe to guarantee the woods are protected from unwanted damage, temperature/humidity changes, without impeding the woods ability to resonate to their fullest.</p><p>The Martin D-18 dreadnought acoustic guitar is quite simply one of the finest acoustic guitar models available, built by a company who have been crating impeccable acoustic guitars since 1833. To ensure you model is kept safe and sound, Martin have included a deluxe hardshell case.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Martin Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,949-949-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/b4f1626116f9ac5c9152d94b472633d3.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Martin D18 Dreadnought Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Martin D18 Dreadnought Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

This new model features an increased scale length to the neck - 17"""" scale length - which greatly improves string sustain and resonance to create a fuller sound, increasing the upper frequency range without sacrificing the unique timbre of the ukulele.</p><p>The G9110-L is fitted with a Fishman KULA preamp system, which makes it an ideal instrument for performing musicians or recording artists who require a versatile instrument that can either be miked up and recorded acoustically, or a signal taken directly from the ukulele itself.</p><h3>Strong design, beautiful body</h3><p>The G9110-L body is composed solely of laminated mahogany. This gives it excellent resilience in handling changes in temperature and humidity - making it an excellent choice for players who intend to transport this ukulele around a lot. The mahogany contributes significantly to the well-formed tonal character exhibited by the G9110-L, delivering a balanced mid to low-end voice.</p><p>The body has been given a light - but robust - coating of open-pore semi-gloss with a honey mahogany stain. This gently accentuates the natural beauty of the tonewood whilst offering protection to keep it in pristine condition for as long as possible.</p><h3>Extended, comfortable neck</h3><p>As already mentioned, the neck receives an extension by 2"""" to give it an overall scale length of 17"""", giving the strings a greater distance to resonate, build a fuller sound and ring out more clearly. The higher frets give a greater depth of flavour to the already rich and versatile tones produced by the concert ukulele shape. Aged pearloid dots adorn the 19 frets in stylish fashion.</p><h3>Bespoke electronics</h3><p>The G9110-L is fitted with a Fishman KULA preamp with a built-in chromatic tuner.

The 5-ply maple tonewood works perfectly with the body design to lay the foundation for a smooth midrange energy that offers a sweet bottom-end and sparkling yet softly rounded highs. The stylish over-sized bound f-holes that are shaped into the top, allow the acoustic timbre to ease through for a smooth, subtle projection.

Fitted to the G5422TG is an adjusto-matic bridge with a secured rosewood-base, which is paired with a glorious Bigsby Licensed B60 vibrato tailpiece.

Alongside vintage-style features resides modern appointments that make this model a truly outstanding work of craftsmanship. It doesn't get much closer to the original than the 2018 Les Paul Traditional. Accompanying the guitar is a Gibson hardshell case and accessory kit.</p><h3> Late '50s Les Paul design </h3><p>To uphold the substantial feel of the late '50s Les Paul, Gibson have kept this as a non-weight relieved model. The result is a substantial yet manageable feel in the hands, with an unbeatable sustain and warmth. The same single-cutaway profile that we've all come to know and love is present and correct.</p><p>The classic tonewood partnership of mahogany body with maple top has been retained too. However, this isn't any old maple, it is grade AA figured maple. The result is a weighty midrange foundation with a clean upper mid to high frequency articulation that shines through. From smooth blues licks to searing high-gain soloing, the heart of the Les Paul produces resounding tones to suit any musical style. The finish has been treated to a slender yet durable layer of gloss nitrocellulose lacquer to protect against premature wear.</p><h3> Classic rounded neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid mahogany neck, which has been shaped to the rounded profile - again, ensuring a substantial yet manageable feel in the hand. Married to the neck is a sublime 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with acrylic trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. Rolled-over-fret cream binding creates seamless transitions between each fret to create the smoothest feel possible.</p><h3> Resilient, stage-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck you'll find the Tektoid nut, which works tirelessly to maintain string tension. The headstock is angled to Gibson's customary 17-degrees to improve tuning stability, whilst the Gibson logo is proudly on display for all to see. The nickel-plated vintage-style keystone tuning machines boast an impressive gear ratio, allowing them to firmly secure your strings during each and every performance. The body is home to the ABR bridge, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar tailpiece to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3>Sublime BurstBucker pickups</h3><p>The Gibson 2018 Les Paul Traditional is equipped with Burstbucker 1 and 2 humbuckers, fitted in the neck and bridge positions respectively. The Alnico II-powered Burstbuckers translate the richness of the body tonewoods, and the articulation of the neck and fingerboard construction with impeccable clarity. Control over the pickups comes in the form of classic gold Top Hat knobs, which complement the stunning finish beautifully.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,582-582-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/5189b751b92ff726e72dea23b6cb4952.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson USA 2018 Les Paul Traditional Guitar - Heritage Cherry Sunburst","Gibson USA 2018 Les Paul Traditional Guitar - Heritage Cherry Sunburst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Don't let the diminuitive dimensions fool you however, this little beauty is equipped with electronics that allow you to go from the most intimate of stages to the grandest of stages. Coming into its 184th year, Martin know a thing or two when it comes to building durable guitars with the ability to endure, and the 00-17SE Black Smoke reaps the rewards of this experience.</p><h3>Grand Concert body</h3><p>The 00-17SE Black Smoke has been crafted to the Grand Concert body shape, which possesses a shallower depth than that of a dreadnought whilst retaining a full waist. The combination results in a body that offers exceptional playing comfort and is great for players with a shorter reach. The timbre produced is delivered with a deft articulation and is often favoured by fingerstyle players.</p><p>Martin has employed solid Sitka spruce as the tonewood of choice for the body top. Boasting the enviable combination of resilience, strength, and flexibility, Sitka is a dream soundboard that projects with graceful dexterity. To prevent unwanted buckling or warping, Martin's time-tested scalloped X-bracing is on hand to ensure that the soundboard is suitably reinforced whilst resonating unimpeded. Grained Ivoroid binding encircles the body top, which complements the cool Black Smoke finish beautifully.</p><p>The back and sides of the guitar are built using mahogany, a naturally dense and warm sounding wood that establishes a hearty mid to low-end timbre, which works well with the Grand Concert body shape to create a subtle tonal balance. The back and sides have been treated to a satin finish, which prevents tackiness from developing to ensure a smooth playing feel every time.</p><h3>Select hardwood neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a select hardwood neck, which is shaped to the modified low oval profile with a high-performance taper. The neck is designed to inspire a fast playing feel, which is enhanced by the addition of a protective satin coating. Married to the neck is a 20-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with Mother of Pearl inlays to guide your way in style.</p><h3> Versatile electronics </h3><p>The Martin 00-17SE Black Smoke is equipped with a Fishman Matrix VT Enhance bridge-plate mounted transducer, which ensures that the acoustic sound of your guitar is amplified transparently. The discreet Volume, Tone and Enhance Blend controls are mounted within the soundhole, and therefore no holes are cut into the body to establish an interface. The rich aesthetic and tonal character of your guitar is preserved in all its glory, whilst offering peerless responsiveness to your playing dynamics and feel.</p><h3>Durable hardware</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a modern straight-line rosewood bridge with drop-in compensated white Tusq saddle. The bridge/saddle partnership creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain. At the top of the neck you'll find the bone nut, which works alongside Golden Age Relic nickel tuning machines to uphold tuning integrity and string tension dutifully.</p><p>The Martin 00-17SE Grand Concert Electro Acoustic Guitar in Black Smoke is perfect for players of any musical style, for flat pickers and fingerstyle players alike. For solo shows, it offers a delightfully intimate sound, and thanks to the built-in Fishman electronics, you can rest assured that it can hold its own as part of any ensemble.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Martin Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,948-948-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/7f1db69ecf61cf149f71ca209fbdeb7a.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Martin 00-17SE Grand Concert Electro Acoustic Guitar - Black Smoke","Martin 00-17SE Grand Concert Electro Acoustic Guitar - Black Smoke",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

For incredible tones, pro-level stage readiness and drop-dead gorgeous looks, the G5439T is an absolute must-have!</p><h3>Body</h3><p>The tonal versatility of the G5439T starts with the tonewood combination in the body. Dense basswood and bright-sounding maple have been employed to carry out the task of delivering a well-developed tonal output. The back is composed of a chambered basswood design, which creates a thick mid to low-end barrage with awesome levels of sustain. The arched maple top counters this with a distinctively bright and snappy charge.</p><p>The body is protected by a resilient coating of gloss polyurethane and gloss polyester, which both work hard to reduce the impact of wear and tear on the mouth-watering silver sparkle finish.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>The slender maple neck assures a supportive and reassuring feel whilst playing. The rosewood fingerboard creates a confident playing surface on which to flex your creative muscles. The 12"""" fingerboard radius is a string bender's dream, allowing smooth bends and reducing the chance of note drop-off. Together the neck and fingerboard woods deliver """"tight"""" note articulation and a generous 24.6"""" scale length for the strings to resonate along, improving the overall sustain significantly.</p><h3>Electronics</h3><p>Two BlackTop Filter'Tron humbuckers at the neck and bridge position give the G5439T a deliciously """"fat"""" sound. At the neck position, sparkling lead/rhythm tones can be plucked out with the greatest of ease. The bridge pickup gives a nice, thumping rumble, that is great for chunky blues and rock licks. Flick the 3-way pickup selector switch to the centre position to combine a bit of both pickups for a swelling, mid-laden tone.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>Here is where the fun begins! Fitted to the G5439T is an anchored Adjusto-Matic bridge with a Bigsby licensed B50 vibrato tailpiece, offering an unbelievable level of creative control over your tone. Personal inflections can be squeezed into every single note, allowing you to truly put your stamp on every performance.</p><p>Vintage-style tuning machines ensure that once you dial in the tuning you want, it stays that way no matter how much you rock out onstage. The synthetic bone nut keeps the string spacing in-check so you can rest assured that no amount of string bending will throw it out of whack.</p><p>The G5439T Pro Jet is a delight to the ears, a feast for the eyes and a dream to play. Fitted with D'Addario XL110 Regular Light strings, you're good to go as soon as you get it.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gretsch Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,652-652-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/ddc3a439afa92b2f54eafdca61c1a0d1.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"G5439T Pro Jet Electric Guitar - Silver Sparkle","G5439T Pro Jet Electric Guitar - Silver Sparkle",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The S series of Ibanez guitars are incredibly well-designed, and the S670QM is just that. With its sculpted double cutaway body and a lightweight but sturdy build, the S670QM feels and sounds dreamy.</p> <h3>Body</h3> <p>As mentioned, the S670QM is shaped to the deep double cutaway shape which opens up access to the neck in its entirety. The body of the guitar sits well against the player, while its lightweight feel reduces fatigue onstage. The body is constructed from mahogany, producing rich, warm tones with clarity. Plus, the body features a quilted maple top that shines radiantly through the eye-catching finish.</p> <h3>Neck</h3> <p>The S670QM is fitted with a smooth maple neck which features the signature Ibanez Wizard III profile. The Wizard III neck is thin and flat which promotes faster playability. A bound rosewood fingerboard tops the neck which feels just right in the hand, facilitating grip and fret transitioning. The fingerboard hosts 24 frets, meaning you have a two-octave fretboard to explore fully. Offset white dot inlays decorate the frets to guide you along.</p> <h3>Quantum Pickups</h3> <p>The S670QM Spot Run is powered by a superb trio of Quantum pickups. The neck and bridge positions feature ceramic humbucking Quantum pickups, while the middle position employs an Alnico-powered Quantum single-coil pickup. The fusion of humbuckers and a single-coil pickup opens up a whole universe of tones, whether you're tearing out solos or using their responsive bass / midrange tones for complex chording.</p> <p>Master Volume and Tone controls allow you to shape your sound with precision, while a 5-way pickup switch blends and separates the pickups.</p> <h3>Hardware and Finish</h3> <p>The S670QM is fitted with an excellent Edge-Zero II tremolo bridge with a stud lock function that improves tuning stability even after plenty of heavy tremolo use. The tuners at the headstock also work alongside the bridge to ensure that each string remains in tune.</p> <p>The spectacular finish of this Spot Run model is matched up with Cosmo Black hardware. The S670QM Spot Run is yet another high quality electric guitar hailing from the Ibanez S line of first-rate instruments to appeal to the masses.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Ibanez Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,816-816-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/68e8f60e9583e043e70dc2b71eb05242.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Ibanez S670QM Electric Guitar","Ibanez S670QM Electric Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Whether you're new to the instrument, or are a seasoned pro, the Less Plus will blow you away.</p><h3> Classic Les Paul design </h3><p>The body has been crafted using a classic Gibson tonewood partnership with mahogany used in the back to create the robust mid to low-end growl, and figured maple top to add high end sensitivity and cut through with striking clarity. The mahogany has been treated to a traditional rout, which lightens the load of the Less Plus whilst retaining the tonewood's crucial timbre and power. The body is very easy to wield, which is great for beginners who are building up playing stamina. Touring player's backs will appreciate the weight relief too. The sublime Fireburst finish shines proudly - especially under hot stage lights -, whilst a protective layer of gloss lacquer keeps it preserved for years to come.</p><h3>Comfortable neck shape</h3><p>A hardy mahogany neck is fitted to the body, providing the perfect platform to run your hands along, with the rounded C profile delivering a substantial feel in the hand. Married to the neck is a sumptuous rosewood fingerboard, home to 22 highly playable frets, and bound to create a smooth playing feel. As with other 2015 models, the neck and fingerboard are now slightly wider (0.050 per side) in order to increase playing comfort and improve the execution of strings bends. Not only that, but every fingerboard is smoother thanks to a new sand/buffering application, as well as a new oil treatment.</p><h3>Peerless Gibson tones </h3><p>The Gibson USA 2015 Les Paul Less Plus has been fitted with a pickup complement of '57 Classic and '57 Classic Plus humbuckers in double black exposed coils - in the neck and bridge positions respectively. If you're not already familiar with these pickups, they're modelled closely on Gibson's coveted Patent Applied For (PAF) pickups. Based around an Alnico II magnet, the '57 Classic has balanced coils that give these beauties a slightly richer tone, whilst the enamel-coated wiring ensures that at higher gain, these two pups maintain their consistency very well. Gibson have enabled coil-splits on both pickups, allowing you to pull single-coil tones from the pickups and expand the tonal versatility of the '57s even further. Whatever style of music you play, you'll easily find the tone you want with these beauties.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The nickel tune-o-matic bridge upholds intonation rigorously and stop bar tailpiece, consistently providing a secure and anchored playing feel. The zero fret nut-patent applied for nut supports each string meticulously, assuring string tension no matter what tuning you select, or how hard you rock out.</p><h3>G Force tuning</h3><p>The Gibson G FORCE system allows you to tune your guitar easily, and quickly. The user interface features an LED display for each string, along with a simple menu layout for rapid navigation. Basic functions include: multi-string tuning - simply press the On button, strum all the strings once, and when all LEDs are green, all six strings are tuned; single-string tuning, which offers greater precision; tuning adjustment - scroll through tuning presets and select a different tuning to the one currently in use, G FORCE does the work for you; and finally you can return to standard tuning at any time easily. The G FORCE system is capable of executing many advanced functions including: saving customised tunings; adjusting individual strings rapidly; and even has a capo mode, which accurately tunes each string with reference to capo placement on the 1st to 6th frets - simply amazing!</p><p>Each model is supplied with a hardshell case that cradles your Less Plus snugly, keeping it safe from harm whether it's kept at home, in the studio, or on the road.</p><p>The Gibson USA 2015 Les Paul Less Plus is incredibly impressive. Reliable, tonally versatile, highly playable, lightweight, produces sustain that runs for miles, has stunning good looks, and even comes with a hardshell case, what more could you possibly want?</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,536-536-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/dc0f583aad2971ab8effd11e7e420cd3.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Les Paul Less Plus Electric Guitar - Fireburst","Gibson Les Paul Less Plus Electric Guitar - Fireburst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The 496R is a high output pickup with an aggressive edge that cuts through the mix with a searing sustain. The 500T boasts an even higher output, with increased note definition and is absolutely perfect for dropping some weighty palm-muted chugging. Whether you're playing along to your favourite tracks at home, or blowing minds - and possibly a few ear drums - to an adoring crowd, these magnificent humbuckers will not disappoint.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of independent volume pots for each pickups, a master tone pot, and a silent, aviation-grade toggle switch for flawless pickup selection.</p><h3> Gig-ready setup </h3><p>Along with the G-FORCE tuning system, the Gibson 2017 Explorer HP has a titanium zero-fret adjustable nut, affording incredible tone, sustain and durability whilst allowing you to set string action with absolute precision.

Each model is supplied with a specially designed Explorer hardshell case in brown, with plush interior to offer a stylish and protective companion.

Not only that, but the inclusion of modern improvements goes towards making the 2018 SG Standard a standout. Add a hardshell case and accessory kit and you've got yourself quite the package!</p><h3>Sublime solidbody SG</h3><p>The Gibson USA 2018 SG Standard is built and shaped to the classic slimline double-cutaway """"horns"""" profile we've all come to know and love. The unfussy yet undeniably cool design has often been imitated but never equalled. With gently bevelled edges and a balanced weight distribution, the 2018 SG is comfortable in the hands and a joy to wield.

Designed to produce a high-gain output, these humbuckers not only offer a sweet rendition of those early pickups, but also slide perfectly into modern day rock styles too. Control over the pickups comes in the form of a pair of volume pots, a pair of tone pots, and a three-way toggle switch to select either pickup independently or both simultaneously. In keeping with the vintage vibe, black 'Top Hat' knobs have been employed as the control pots.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The headstock is home to a bell-shaped chrome truss rod cover, whilst the distinctive Gibson logo resides between the locking kidney tuning machines. The tuners and Tektoid nut work dutifully to uphold tuning integrity and string tension. The body is home to the chrome finished aluminium Tune-O-Matic bridge, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar tailpiece, a combination that anchors each string securely to optimise intonation and sustain throughout the most emphatic of performances.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,600-600-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/ecbbe8cfa5a58a5287500527435d4c89.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson USA 2018 SG Standard Electric Guitar - Autumn Shade","Gibson USA 2018 SG Standard Electric Guitar - Autumn Shade",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

You can rest assured that no matter how hard you play, the neck is built with durability at its heart. Thanks to its slimtaper profile, the neck is delightfully slender and accommodating most player's hands with ease.</p><p>Married to the neck is a rosewood fingerboard, which plays home to 22 frets that are adorned with trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. Cream binding along the fingerboard ensures seamless transitions between frets, whilst the standard 12-inch radius makes it a breeze to perform smooth string bends.</p><h3>P90 vintage tone</h3><p>To create a tonal match for the sophisticated '60s/'70s aesthetic, the Gibson 2018 Les Paul Classic Electric Guitar is equipped with a pair of P90 single coil pickups to give it the depth and warmth it deserves. The crispness of the maple rings truly, offering a snappy juxtaposition to the warm, dense mahogany.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes via the pickup independent volume and tone controls, which allow you to sculpt and shape your tone with precision. Orange Drop capacitors ensure that the slightest of adjustments is executed as smoothly as possible, putting absolute tone control in your hands.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>The headstock is home to Grover's kidney style locking tuners with an impressive tuning ratio, so you can rest assured that no slipping will occur during any emphatic string bending. The strings meet the body via the ABR bridge and aluminium stop bar tailpiece. From the tuning machines down to the tailpiece, everything is designed and fitted to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>Each Gibson USA 2018 Les Paul Classic Electric Guitar model is supplied with a classic Gibson hardshell case in brown to protect your pride and joy and an accessory kit so that you can protect and enjoy this exquisite guitar as soon as you get it home.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,562-562-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/b506294f8d4797d96f3f3cf9c09bb1ea.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson USA 2018 Les Paul Classic Electric Guitar","Gibson USA 2018 Les Paul Classic Electric Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Maintaining that distinct, traditional double cutaway body with some new, updated appointments to go with it, the 2017 SG Special HP is truly built for incredible, high performance as its title suggests.</p><h3>BODY</h3><p>The SG Special has a body constructed from mahogany, a predominant choice of tonewood in Gibson's history due to its beautiful tone delivery. The double cutaway body has been given a satin-nitrocellulose finish for that tidy appearance. Gibson have also equipped the SG Special HP with a sculpted fast access heel for exceptional, easy reach to every fret.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>The 2017 SG Special HP is fitted with a smooth, Soloist mahogany neck that is shaped to the very favourable Slim Taper profile. The Soloist neck width allows a much faster playing feel with more room, so shredding riffs is easier than ever.</p><p>The neck is topped with a 12 inch radius rosewood fingerboard, providing the most sumptuous playing surface beneath the fingertips. Decorating the frets for a traditional look are small Mother of Pearl block inlays to guide you. For total control over the string action and for better sustain there is a titanium zero-fret adjustable nut.</p><h3>HUMBUCKER PICKUPS</h3><p>For a modern, accurate take on vintage PAF-style Gibson tone, the SG Special HP is fitted with a pair of humbucker pickups. A 490R is fitted in the neck position joined by a 498T in the bridge position. This pickup duo provide a great range of tonal depth, just as you would expect from Gibson humbuckers. Each pickup works to prevent unwanted interference or hum.</p><p>Despite having some new, updated features, the 2017 SG Special HP still has four main control pots for rhythm and lead Volume and Tone, plus the usual 3-way toggle pickup switch to shape your sound.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The headstock may look traditional with the chrome bell-shaped truss rod cover, Gibson logo and crown, however it has been fitted with the updated G-FORCE tuners. The G-FORCE tuners provide a much faster way of retuning your strings and with great precision, too. Gibson have also ensured that the tuning gears have been quietened to avoid unwanted noise.</p><p>The body is fitted with a traditional chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with titanium saddles and an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece with locking studs for quality sustain and resonance.</p><p>The SG style pickguard protects the body, keeping the finish looking neat. To help the owner keep this guitar in the best possible condition for years to come, Gibson include a padded HP gigbag, guitar strap and polishing cloth.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,472-472-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/392e0075e3dcc143400d5bbc0b83f1ec.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 SG Special HP Electric Guitar - Satin Vintage Sunburst","Gibson 2017 SG Special HP Electric Guitar - Satin Vintage Sunburst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The result is a rendition of the famous """"Workhorse"""" that offers enhanced playing comfort whilst retaining the same vigorous energy and resilience.</p><h3>Dreadnought power</h3><p>The Gibson J-45 is highly respected the world over thanks to its impressive dynamic range, hardy build quality, and rich acoustic timbre. The 2018 J-45 Avant Garde back and sides are crafted using walnut, a hardwood that produces a warm midrange timbre whilst establishing a reassuringly robust feel. The top is built using Sitka spruce, a tonewood that is favoured in soundboard construction thanks to its excellent ability to resonate and project tones with confidence. The top is reinforced using traditional hand-scalloped X-bracing, allowing to resonate unimpeded whilst preventing buckling or warping over time.</p><h3>Sturdy neck design</h3><p>Married to the body via a compound dovetail joint is a supple two-piece maple neck, which has been shaped to the advanced response profile for a slimmer feel in the hand. Married to the neck is a luxurious walnut fingerboard, which is home to 20 frets that are adorned with mother of pearl dot position inlays to provide a lavish navigational aid. The fingerboard is polished with finishing oil to enhance the natural compounds of the wood, thus giving it a lasting feel of elegance.</p><h3>Gig-ready appointments</h3><p>The headstock is home to Mini Grover tuners, which uphold tuning integrity with precision. The body is home to the rounded rectangle walnut bridge, which creates a seamless connection between the strings and body for optimised intonation and sustain. The result is a guitar that performs with consistency every time you pick up and play. Whether you're recording in the studio or taking to the stage, knowing that you can rely on your instrument is of the utmost importance. You can put all your trust in the J-45.</p><h3> L.R. Baggs Element VTC Pickup System </h3><p>Equipped with the award-winning L.R. Baggs Element VTC electronics' system, you can take to the stage in effortless style and plug directly into the amp or P.A. of your choosing, safe in the knowledge that the acoustic character of your guitar will be translated transparently.</p><p>The pre-attached Element pickup, and all-discrete endpin preamp are controlled using the soundhole-mounted volume and tone controls. The built-in low frequency crossover prevents any unwanted low-end grunt from over-powering your signal, and allows the natural timbre of the J-45 to sing with the utmost clarity.</p><p>The Gibson Acoustic 2018 J-45 Avant Garde Acoustic Guitar in Walnut Burst is supplied with a Gibson hardshell case, as well as a Gibson accessory kit. Wherever your music takes you, you can get your guitar there in security and style, and keep it in top condition for years to come.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,500-500-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/80d8cdd5212d9366e849e68ef0795adc.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Acoustic 2018 J-45 Avant Garde Acoustic Guitar - Walnut Burst","Gibson Acoustic 2018 J-45 Avant Garde Acoustic Guitar - Walnut Burst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Alongside vintage-style features resides modern appointments that make this model a truly outstanding work of craftsmanship. It doesn't get much closer to the original than the 2018 Les Paul Traditional. Accompanying the guitar is a Gibson hardshell case and accessory kit.</p><h3> Late '50s Les Paul design </h3><p>To uphold the substantial feel of the late '50s Les Paul, Gibson have kept this as a non-weight relieved model. The result is a substantial yet manageable feel in the hands, with an unbeatable sustain and warmth. The same single-cutaway profile that we've all come to know and love is present and correct.</p><p>The classic tonewood partnership of mahogany body with maple top has been retained too. However, this isn't any old maple, it is grade AA figured maple. The result is a weighty midrange foundation with a clean upper mid to high frequency articulation that shines through. From smooth blues licks to searing high-gain soloing, the heart of the Les Paul produces resounding tones to suit any musical style. The finish has been treated to a slender yet durable layer of gloss nitrocellulose lacquer to protect against premature wear.</p><h3> Classic rounded neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid mahogany neck, which has been shaped to the rounded profile - again, ensuring a substantial yet manageable feel in the hand. Married to the neck is a sublime 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with acrylic trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. Rolled-over-fret cream binding creates seamless transitions between each fret to create the smoothest feel possible.</p><h3> Resilient, stage-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck you'll find the Tektoid nut, which works tirelessly to maintain string tension. The headstock is angled to Gibson's customary 17-degrees to improve tuning stability, whilst the Gibson logo is proudly on display for all to see. The nickel-plated vintage-style keystone tuning machines boast an impressive gear ratio, allowing them to firmly secure your strings during each and every performance. The body is home to the ABR bridge, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar tailpiece to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3>Sublime BurstBucker pickups</h3><p>The Gibson 2018 Les Paul Traditional is equipped with Burstbucker 1 and 2 humbuckers, fitted in the neck and bridge positions respectively. The Alnico II-powered Burstbuckers translate the richness of the body tonewoods, and the articulation of the neck and fingerboard construction with impeccable clarity. Control over the pickups comes in the form of classic gold Top Hat knobs, which complement the stunning finish beautifully.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,579-579-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/103dddd577765b1bae4a5da7e92ce6f4.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson USA 2018 Les Paul Traditional Electric Guitar","Gibson USA 2018 Les Paul Traditional Electric Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Through a combination of vintage-style and updated technology, Gibson has captured the vibrant energy and character of a classic Les Paul, whilst exceeding the tonal demands of today's guitarists.</p><h3>Sleek Les Paul design</h3><p>As you'd expect, the body is crafted using classic combination of two-piece mahogany that has been combined with a grade A plain maple top. The mahogany has been treated to a 9-hole weight relief rout, which makes the body lighter and easier to wield, without losing any of that raw Les Paul power. The maple doesn't just look pretty either; it lends itself to a sweetly delivered high-end that allows this beauty to truly sparkle. The body protected by a smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer, which preserves that natural grain and paintwork to allow your Les Paul to age gracefully.</p><h3>Single-piece mahogany neck</h3><p>To create a confident playing feel, Gibson have fitted a single-piece mahogany neck using a solid mortise and tenon joint reinforced using Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive. You can rest assured that no matter how hard you play, the neck is built with durability at its heart. Thanks to its slimtaper profile, the neck is delightfully slender and accommodating most player's hands with ease.</p><p>Married to the neck is a heavenly rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. Cream binding along the fingerboard ensures seamless transitions between frets, whilst the standard 12-inch radius makes it a breeze to perform smooth string bends.</p><h3>Zebra '57 Classic humbuckers</h3><p>To create a tonal match for the sophisticated '60s/'70s aesthetic, the Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar is equipped with a Zebra '57 Classic in the neck position, and a Zebra '57 Classic Plus in the bridge. The depth and warmth of the mahogany is given the commanding presence it deserves, with a hearty mid to low-end energy flowing from the pickups, thanks to the wound Alnico II magnet-driven humbuckers. The crispness of the maple rings truly, offering a snappy counterpoint to the dense mahogany.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes via the pickup independent volume and tone controls, which allow you to sculpt and shape your tone with precision. Orange Drop capacitors ensure that the slightest of adjustments is executed as smoothly as possible, putting absolute tone control in your hands.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>The headstock is home to Grover's zamak locking tuners with an impressive 14:01 tuning ratio, so you can rest assured that no slipping will occur during any emphatic string bending. The strings meet the body via the nickel-plated zamak ABR bridge and nickel-plated aluminium stop bar tailpiece. From the tuning machines down to the tailpiece, everything is designed and fitted to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>Each Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar model is supplied with a classic Gibson hardshell case in brown to protect your pride and joy whether it is in storage or in transit. With the 2017 model you will also receive a Gibson USA multi tool, premium strap, polishing cloth, and owner's manual to help you to keep your Les Paul in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,442-442-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/1da3bd001773e490cc36774b18e2ae0d.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Guitar - Heritage Cherry Sunburst","Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Guitar - Heritage Cherry Sunburst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Now the guys at Gibson Custom have brought it back with historically accurate appointments to give you a reincarnation that is as close to the original as possible. This was one of the first Gibson sunburst models which has since become legendary and this new version brings it right up to date.</p><h3>MAPLE AND MAHOGANY</h3><p>In 1958 when Gibson first designed the original Les Paul Standard guitars, they would all feature a two-piece maple body top, and the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard indeed has a two-piece figured maple top. Figured maple is instantly eye-catching due to its flame-like texture while it also contributes to producing that vintage, '58 sound of the original.</p><p>The top is accompanied by mahogany in the back and sides which makes for the perfect partnership with the figured maple top to produce a strong, resonant output as authentic as those models which were first released in the late 50s. This version is given the 1950s style Les Paul body contour with no weight relief for a historically correct feel.</p><h3>VINTAGE CORRECT NECK</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard is fitted with a single-piece mahogany neck with a comfortable 1950's style Les Paul profile. It is firmly joined to the body using hot hide-glue which was a constitutional element of the original guitars. The neck also has a historic long-tenon neck joint which enables the guitar to precisely convey its classic tone.</p><p>Aboard the neck is a solid, one-piece Indian rosewood fingerboard which assists the mahogany in providing an all-round Les Paul sound. With 22 frets at your service, you can work your way up and down the neck in confidence thanks to the cellulose Trapezoid inlays.</p><h3>CUSTOM BUCKER PICKUPS</h3><p>Gibson have employed Custom Bucker pickups in the electronics of the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard, and consider them to be their best replica of PAF pickups yet. The Custom Buckers achieve an output that is as close to the original sound of a '58 guitar as you can imagine. Each pickup is powered by Alnico III magnets which deliver you a mix of epic ringing or deep rumble depending on the sound output that you require.</p><p>To help you control the rhythm and lead pickups, the guitar is fitted with two Volume and two Tone pots with matched 500k potentiometers and encased with gold top hats.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard has an ABR bridge with thumbwheels partnered with a lightweight aluminium stop bar tailpiece which enhances the overall intonation and sustain. At the top end of the guitar at the headstock we have reissue Kluson deluxe green keys made with nickel plated steel to uphold tuning integrity with accuracy.</p><p>Protecting the beautiful, hand-sprayed nitrocellulose finish on the body is a 1950's style cream pickguard which also really complements the guitar. The guitar also comes equipped with a reissue Les Paul case with a brown outer and pink fur lining to further protect this wonderful guitar.</p><p>It is without doubt that the new range of Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard guitars are as authentic as you could wish for in sound, feel and appearance.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,550-550-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/ea5bbbe65bcf934eab82e61fd75ef913.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul - Washed Cherry VOS","Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul - Washed Cherry VOS",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The 496R is a high output pickup with an aggressive edge that cuts through the mix with a searing sustain. The 500T boasts an even higher output, with increased note definition and is absolutely perfect for dropping some weighty palm-muted chugging. Whether you're playing along to your favourite tracks at home, or blowing minds - and possibly a few ear drums - to an adoring crowd, these magnificent humbuckers will not disappoint.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of independent volume pots for each pickups, a master tone pot, and a silent, aviation-grade toggle switch for flawless pickup selection.</p><h3> Gig-ready setup </h3><p>Along with the G-FORCE tuning system, the Gibson 2017 Explorer HP has a titanium zero-fret adjustable nut, affording incredible tone, sustain and durability whilst allowing you to set string action with absolute precision.

With select tonewoods, versatile electronics, and robust hardware at your disposal, Jackson have once again thought of everything to ensure the Kelly JS32 is an exceptional model for its price.</p><h3> Slick Kelly body </h3><p>Since it burst onto the scene in the early '80s, the Kelly has been the weapon of choice for many hard rockers and metallers. Thanks to its balanced and lightweight feel, superb playability, and not least its unabashed style, it quickly became an instant classic. The JS32 series Kelly adheres to those same principles, employing poplar as the body tonewood to guarantee a lightweight feel that makes it a joy to perform with. Finished with a cool snow white paint job, the body is protected by a layer of gloss to prevent unwanted scratches and blemishes.</p><h3> Reinforced neck design </h3><p>Jackson appreciate that the Kelly is a guitar that is built for the stage, and is going to be shown off. With that in mind, they also appreciate that humidity and temperature changes can have a devastating effect on a guitar's neck. Therefore, they have reinforced the bolt-on single-piece maple neck using graphite, which prevents unwanted twisting and warping over time. You can rest assured that where you take your guitar, it will be ready to rock every time. Thanks to a satin finish, your hand can glide along the neck with ease, free from unwanted stickiness or tackiness from impeding your movement.</p><p>Partnered with the neck is a dark rosewood fingerboard, which has 24 jumbo frets that are decorated with pearloid sharkfin position inlays. Jackson's customary compound radius fingerboard creates a natural feel for the fingers as they navigate the playing surface. Paired with the speed neck profile, you can rest assured that every effort has been made to establish a lightning fast playing feel.</p><h3> Jackson high output humbuckers </h3><p>The Jackson JS Series Kelly JS32 is equipped with a pair of their high output humbuckers, which generate a punchy and defiant output that puts a wide range of tones at the ready. Everything from crisp cleans that could cut through glass to headbanger-worthy aggressive chunk is present and correct. Control over the pickups comes in the form of a master volume pot, a mater tone pot, and a three-way pickups selector switch to keep everything simple yet effective.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>The body is fitted with a Floyd Rose Licensed Jackson double locking tremolo bridge, which lays the foundation for pinpoint accurate vibrato control. The Floyd Rose R3 locking nut anchors each string so that no matter how much you dive and wail with the bridge, your strings remain firmly intact and ready for action. The feel of the bridge is highly responsive, giving you complete mastery over your vibrato.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Jackson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,894-894-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/275d877c58e4657b2daf02ed6facbf7c.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Jackson JS Series Kelly JS32 Electric Guitar - Snow White","Jackson JS Series Kelly JS32 Electric Guitar - Snow White",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Released at the 1987 Chicago NAMM Show, the Steve Vai-designed JEM marked a major turning point in the history of Ibanez, and the development of the electric guitar. Becoming an icon to rival other models, the JEM has gone on to spawn the ever-popular RG series, which is only second to another legendary model. Staking its place in musical history, the Ibanez JEM777 is a heavenly guitar that fortunately us mere mortals can play, and with this very special 30th Anniversary model, we are truly spoilt. </p> <h3> Unique JEM body design</h3> <p> The body is shaped to the same ergonomically designed profile as the original. With gentle bevelled edges and curves in all the right places, this is a model that sits as sweetly during performances for maximum playing comfort. Vai was perplexed by the way other models impeded access to the upper frets, hence the deep double-cutaway that opens the fretboard in its entirety for you to explore. </p> <p> The body is crafted from basswood, a medium-weight tonewood that boasts a well-defined midrange energy with subtle low-end power. The highs like to sizzle before never overpower the timbre, and are never harsh on the ears. Each note is given the space it deserves, ensuring an articulate output across the frequency spectrum. The body is equipped with a pickguard to protect areas around the control knobs and the underside of the strings. Finally, we can't forget the distinctive Vai-designed 'monkey grip' located above the strings, which allows you to carry the guitar easily. </p> <h3> Lightning fast JEM 5-piece maple/walnut neck </h3> <p> The neck is shaped to the lightning fast JEM profile. Crafted from a 5-piece combination of maple and walnut, this is a virtuoso's dream, thanks to the razor thin dimensions that allow your finger to soar. If you're looking for a dream neck to play heavenly sweeps on, then this is the neck for you. </p> <p> A luxurious maple fingerboard is married to the neck, adorned with the truly unique disappearing pyramid inlay, guiding your way in beautiful style. The inclusion of 6105 frets guarantee exceptionally smooth string bends, whilst the Prestige fret edge treatment promises seamless transitions between frets. Not only that but delicate scalloping between the 21st and 24th frets gives unrivalled control and ease of access to the upper frets. </p> <h3> DiMarzio Evolution pickups </h3> <p> To cover the versatile range of tones that Vai is known for producing, DiMarzio Evolution pickups are utilised in the neck, middle and bridge positions. The neck and bridge pickups are passive/ceramic humbuckers and the middle pickup is a passive/alnico single-coil. The 5-way selector switch allows you to pull a wide array of tones from this pickup compliment - from gentle soft-rock tones, tight and clean jazz lick, dense hard rock and ear-piercing metal. Simply put, if you're a session player or a guitarist who likes to mix it up, the Evos have got you covered! </p> <h3> Life-changing Lion's Claw </h3> <p> The JEM777 was designed with the unique Lion's Claw tremolo cavity, which allowed the Edge tremolo to wail as well as dive, lending itself perfectly to Vai's enigmatic playing style. Thanks to the tuning machine, locking nut, and Edge bridge partnership, once you are tuned up and locked in, you can rest assured that tuning integrity, intonation and sustain will remain faithful throughout the most energetic of performances. </p> <p> For protection on the go, a specially designed hardshell case is included to protect your pride and joy from unwanted bumps and scrapes. The Ibanez JEM777 30th Anniversary Edition Electric Guitar is supplied with Certificate of Authenticity (Tour Pass), whilst a JEM 30th Anniversary logo neck plate adds an extra special finishing touch. </p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Ibanez Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,768-768-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/8718ed8147546870494a611e3f0cec7d.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Ibanez JEM777 30th Anniversary Edition Electric Guitar","Ibanez JEM777 30th Anniversary Edition Electric Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Equipped with a powerful trio of U.S.-made DiMarzio pickups, it is as versatile as it is beautiful. </p> <p> Since its release over 30 years ago, the RG body shape has been a favourite amongst metallers, shredders, and virtuosos, who need an instrument that feels solid and reassuring, yet lightweight and free. </p> <p> The body is crafted from basswood, a tonally neutral wood that allows the pickups to soar, and delivers a robust sustain that ensures your tone will gallop. Finished in a sophisticated White Pearl Metallic paintjob, the RG2550Z is perfect for stealing the limelight on stage. </p> <h3> Neck </h3> <p> As with all Ibanez guitars, the neck has been crafted with delicate care and precision to ensure it is as smooth, fast and easy to play as possible. The 5-piece maple/walnut neck is tonally bright - complementing the rich lower tones produced by the body -, with articulation infused into each and every note across the luxurious rosewood fingerboard. The extra-long scale Wizard HP neck profile ensures an enduring sustain, as well as a super slim playing platform to elegantly perform fretboard gymnastics on. The RG2550Z benefits from the Prestige Fret-Edge Treatment, guaranteeing smooth transitions along the neck as you play. </p> <h3> Electronics </h3> <p> In order to deliver the greatest breadth of tonal diversity, Ibanez has fitted this Prestige model with three outstanding US-made DiMarzio pickups. In the neck position is the Air Norton passive humbucker, in the middle is a True Velvet passive single-coil, and in the bridge is The Tone Zone passive humbucker. This trio equips you with everything you need to perform subtle clean licks to taking to the heavens. </p> <p> Control over the pickups comes in the form of a 5-way pickup selector switch to access each pickup individually, or combining the inner coil of the neck or bridge pickup with the middle. The master volume and master tone controls do the rest, so all you need to do is rock out. </p> <h3> Hardware </h3> <p> The Edge-Zero tremolo bridge with Zero Point System 3, allows you to dive-bomb and wail to your heart's content. No matter how aggressive or frenetic your style, the highly responsive trem system will ensure that your strings retain their tuning without any fuss. Minor adjustments can be made on the fly and the tension of the whammy bar can be modified to suit your playing style.

Offering a richly textured and full-bodied sound, which is responsive to the lightest of touches, the body offers an outstanding dynamic range. Whether you prefer to attack the strings with a fast picking or strumming style, or prefer to play with a deft fingerstyle technique, the Taylor 356ce delivers a beautifully lush tone.</p><p>Taylor twelve-strings employ reinforced braces in comparison to 6-strings to account for the increased string tension and to prevent the top from buckling.

Sapele is known for having similar harmonic qualities to mahogany in delivering soothing lows and warm mid tones.

The beautiful natural finish combined with the modest design of the metal cone not only looks wonderful, but also produces rich and powerful tones.</p><p>To give the body of the G9220 a rugged and reliable feel, laminated mahogany has been tasked with the job of generating a generous stirring mid to low-end warmth. As the mahogany is laminated, this gives the wood fantastic resilience in handling changes in temperature and humidity, making it perfect for globetrotting musicians. The top has been given a subtle 2-colour sunburst finish, complete with """"F"""" holes to accentuate the top's projection. Into the body sits the all-new Gretsch """"Ampli-Sonic"""" diaphragm (resonator cone), which is hand-spun in Eastern Europe from nearly 99-percent pure aluminium, allowing it to yield an impressive sonic quality with a wide dynamic range.</p><p>Fitted to the body is the sturdy mahogany neck, which has been shaped to a classic medium """"V"""" profile. The neck has been finished in semi-gloss vintage sunburst.

The bone nut maintains string tension for a consistent playing feel - important when performing slide.</p><p>Whether you're an amateur or a touring pro, if you've coveted the classic resonator tone's associated with players like Son House, or styles such as blues, bluegrass and country of the 1920s/30s, then the Gretsch G9220 Bobtail round-neck resonator takes you closer than ever to reaching tonal nirvana.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gretsch Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,659-659-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/93c87fe60d1b95f3de6f368d547ab0eb.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"G9220 Bobtail Round Neck Resonator Guitar","G9220 Bobtail Round Neck Resonator Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Though it has long been associated with hard rock and metal, it is a much more versatile instrument that is well suited to a wide range of other styles from jazz to blues, prog and grunge. The 2017 HP (High Performance) model is endowed with a selection of premium appointments that makes this the perfect choice for professionals who want a powerful workhorse that is built for life on the road.</p><h3>The Flying V</h3><p>Just looking at the Flying V, it becomes immediately clear as to where its name comes from. Multi-cut mahogany has been employed as the body tonewood, giving the V a commanding mid to low-end energy. Though it comes in at under 4lbs, the guitar produces an enduring sustain. As with other models in the 2017 range, Gibson has increased the comfortability of the guitar by including a sculpted fast-access heel. This accompanies a flat carve body contour and makes it even more enjoyable to wield.</p><h3>Slimtaper Flying V profile</h3><p>Securely fitted to the V-shape body - via a traditional Mortis and Tenon joint with Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive reinforcement - is a single-piece mahogany neck. Shaped to the Flying V slimtaper profile, Gibson have designed this neck with soloists in mind to be a fast and smooth playing dream. Married to the neck is a 22-fret grenadillo fingerboard, which is decorated with Mother-of-Pearl dot inlays to conduct your way up and down the frets with confidence.</p><p>At the top of the neck is an innovative titanium zero-fret adjustable nut, which couples exceptional sustain with outstanding resonance for a rich, full-bodied tone. The zero-fret nut also gives the neck and strings the fastest action to date, perfect for rock guitarists who play at break-neck speeds.</p><h3>Dirty Finger+ pickups</h3><p>The Dirty Fingers+ humbuckers are Ceramic magnet-powered high gain monsters that deliver searing tones to die for. These beauties are perfect for taking centre stage, with a loud and aggressive edge that pushes amps hard - making them a fantastic partner for your tube/valve amp. Beefing up the sustain generated by the body/neck combo, the Dirty Fingers+ sing with absolute clarity.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of newly designed knurled knobs, with added grip to ensure greater precision when making tonal adjustments during energetic sets.</p><h3> Improved G-FORCE auto-tuning </h3><p>Gibson has equipped the 2017 Flying V HP with an updated version of their G-FORCE auto-tuning system. This sits at the back of the headstock, and gives you access to alternate tunings and adjustment with greater speed and accuracy. The improved synchronized spur gear system operates smoothly and quietly, and boasts a highly impressive 40:01 gear ratio - you can rest assured that once your tuning is set, it will remain that way no matter how hard you rock out.</p><h3>Stage-ready hardware</h3><p>The Gibson 2017 Flying V HP is fitted with a chrome-plated Tune-o-Matic bridge with titanium saddles and locking thumbwheels, which is paired with a chrome-plated aluminium stopbar tailpiece with locking studs. The titanium saddles further enhance the sustain and helps to produce a crystal clear, bright sound.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>Each Gibson 2017 Flying V HP Electric Guitar model is supplied with a hardshell case in aluminium to protect your pride and joy whether it is in storage or in transit. With the 2017 model you will also receive a Gibson USA multi tool, premium strap, polishing cloth, and owner's manual to help you to keep your Flying V in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,440-440-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/6b777de46c7228faba13abcb9cc3bb74.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 Flying V HP Electric Guitar - Ebony","Gibson 2017 Flying V HP Electric Guitar - Ebony",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The body is crafted using mahogany, which establishes a solid midrange tonal foundation. Paired with the body is a visually commanding AA figured maple top, which sets off the spectacular visual aesthetic beautifully.

Married to the neck is a luxurious rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 24 low profile frets that have been cryogenically treated. The fingerboard is adorned with pearl trapezoid position inlays to guide you along its entire length.</p><h3>'57 Classic humbuckers</h3><p>Gibson have employed a pair of classic humbucker pickups in the 2018 SG Standard HP, with a '57 Classic in the neck position and a Super '57 Classic in the bridge position. The '57 Classic humbuckers are designed to accurately replicate the original PAF-style tone heard on the original SG models.</p><p>However, the modern-day twist on the electronics setup makes the Standard HP a highly adaptable model, expanding the tonal versatility of the SG further than before. The volume pots have push-pull switches to coil tap each pickup, whilst the DIP switch enables a range of tones to be plucked from the humbuckers. Whatever style of music you play, this guitar can traverse any musical landscape with ease.</p><h3>Improved G-FORCE tuning system</h3><p>Gibson's G-FORCE auto-tuning system has also been given an upgrade, so that fast, accurate string tuning is now even easier than ever before. Whether you're playing in standard, using an alternate tuning, or making up your own that you can save and recall at a later time, you'll be amazed at how smoothly the G-FORCE system operates.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The headstock is home to a bell-shaped chrome truss rod cover, whilst the distinctive Gibson logo resides between the tuning machines. The body is home to the chrome finished aluminium Tune-O-Matic bridge with titanium saddles, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar tailpiece. Everything has been designed and fitted to contribute to the SG Standard HP's superb sustain.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,593-593-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/5b462ca64168f4f368d9963514caeca7.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson USA 2018 SG Standard HP Electric Guitar - Cobalt Fade","Gibson USA 2018 SG Standard HP Electric Guitar - Cobalt Fade",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Now the guys at Gibson Custom have brought it back with historically accurate appointments to give you a reincarnation that is as close to the original as possible. This was one of the first Gibson sunburst models which has since become legendary and this new version brings it right up to date.</p><h3>MAPLE AND MAHOGANY</h3><p>In 1958 when Gibson first designed the original Les Paul Standard guitars, they would all feature a two-piece maple body top, and the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard indeed has a two-piece figured maple top. Figured maple is instantly eye-catching due to its flame-like texture while it also contributes to producing that vintage, '58 sound of the original.</p><p>The top is accompanied by mahogany in the back and sides which makes for the perfect partnership with the figured maple top to produce a strong, resonant output as authentic as those models which were first released in the late 50s. This version is given the 1950s style Les Paul body contour with no weight relief for a historically correct feel.</p><h3>VINTAGE CORRECT NECK</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard is fitted with a single-piece mahogany neck with a comfortable 1950's style Les Paul profile. It is firmly joined to the body using hot hide-glue which was a constitutional element of the original guitars. The neck also has a historic long-tenon neck joint which enables the guitar to precisely convey its classic tone.</p><p>Aboard the neck is a solid, one-piece Indian rosewood fingerboard which assists the mahogany in providing an all-round Les Paul sound. With 22 frets at your service, you can work your way up and down the neck in confidence thanks to the cellulose Trapezoid inlays.</p><h3>CUSTOM BUCKER PICKUPS</h3><p>Gibson have employed Custom Bucker pickups in the electronics of the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard, and consider them to be their best replica of PAF pickups yet. The Custom Buckers achieve an output that is as close to the original sound of a '58 guitar as you can imagine. Each pickup is powered by Alnico III magnets which deliver you a mix of epic ringing or deep rumble depending on the sound output that you require.</p><p>To help you control the rhythm and lead pickups, the guitar is fitted with two Volume and two Tone pots with matched 500k potentiometers and encased with gold top hats.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard has an ABR bridge with thumbwheels partnered with a lightweight aluminium stop bar tailpiece which enhances the overall intonation and sustain. At the top end of the guitar at the headstock we have reissue Kluson deluxe green keys made with nickel plated steel to uphold tuning integrity with accuracy.</p><p>Protecting the beautiful, hand-sprayed nitrocellulose finish on the body is a 1950's style cream pickguard which also really complements the guitar. The guitar also comes equipped with a reissue Les Paul case with a brown outer and pink fur lining to further protect this wonderful guitar.</p><p>It is without doubt that the new range of Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard guitars are as authentic as you could wish for in sound, feel and appearance.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,541-541-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/4a5ad737e3d8d174bbc22f14c3f902ac.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul - Faded Tobacco VOS","Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul - Faded Tobacco VOS",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The body still has its classic shape, however it is lighter than ever. Gibson luthiers have employed a new Ultra-Modern weight relief technique in the mahogany body which improves tone and boosts playing comfort, thus reducing fatigue onstage.</p><p>The mahogany body is joined by an A-grade plain maple top, hand-picked by the expert luthiers at Gibson to provide better, truer Gibson tones. A coat of protective Hi-Gloss Lacquer / 90 Sheen finishes the body top for a stunning visual aesthetic.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>Using the traditional Mortis and Tenon joint and reliable, time-tested Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive, Gibson have joined a smooth mahogany neck. The neck has a more comfortable Slim Taper profile which enhances and promotes a faster playing style.</p><p>Topping the neck is a thicker rosewood fingerboard with a 12 inch radius and 22 frets to explore. The thickness of the rosewood is a contributor to the tonal depth on offer from this stunning 2017 model. Frets feature the traditional trapezoid inlays to guide you. A Tektoid nut that is self-lubricating has also been fitted for a better return to pitch and improved sustain.</p><h3>ELECTRONICS</h3><p>The 2017 Les Paul Studio T has been equipped with a pair of superb humbucker pickups; a 490R pickup in the neck position powered by an Alnico II magnet, and a 498T pickup powered by an Alnico V magnet in the bridge position. Each pickup has been crafted to replicate authentic PAF-style Gibson tones, while they also work relentlessly to cancel out any unwanted noise or interference for a much cleaner output.</p><p>The Les Paul Studio T features four control pots for rhythm and lead Volume and Tone, including two push/pull controls for independent coil tapping.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>For unrivalled sustain and resonance, the body is fitted with a chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge accompanied by an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece, the most modern bridge/tailpiece combination that there is.</p><p>The headstock is fitted with Grover Kidney chrome-plated tuning keys set to an accurate 18:01 gear ratio.</p><p>A protective Les Paul pickguard preserves the body top against scratches, while also complementing the finish of the guitar.

The sturdy workmanship comes as no surprise, the team at Gretsch know a thing or two about crafting road-ready models that keep up with the most demanding of performers. The stylish vintage finishes are matched by perfectly appointed modern touches that combine to create a heavenly instrument. If you're a left-handed rock 'n' roller, then it doesn't get much better than the G5420LH.</p><h3> Bound single-cutaway body </h3><p>Gretsch have shaped the G5420LH to a thinline hollow body design, which is built to create the perfect marriage of comfortability and tonal versatility. By using 5-ply maple as the body tonewood, the guitar is afforded a confident midrange character that has a gently rounded bottom-end, and sings across the highs with a sparkling clarity.</p><p>The body top is decorated with stylish over-sized bound f-holes that allows the acoustic timbre to project forth gracefully. The body is bound to create a stylish transition between the top and side woods. The paintwork has been treated to a slender yet resilient coating of gloss to preserving it for as long as possible. The body is completed by the application of a silver plexi pickguard, which proudly displays a black Gretsch logo.</p><h3> Gloss-finished maple neck </h3><p>Paired with the body is a gloss-finished maple neck, which is carved to a """"U""""-shape profile to guarantee a supportive and reassuring playing feel in the hand. Married to the neck is a bound rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 medium jumbo-sized frets that bear offset pearloid neo-classic thumbnail position inlays. The neck and fingerboard partnership establishes a confident playing feel, encouraging your fingers to roam freely. The 12-inch fingerboard radius allows your fretting hand to roll around in comfort, whilst string bends can be executed smoothly. The single cutaway body profile makes it significantly easier to reach the upper frets comfortably.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck is a Graph Tech nubone nut, which works in partnership with the vintage-style open-back tuning machines to uphold string tension and tuning integrity. Fitted to the G5420LH is an adjusto-matic bridge with a secured rosewood-based, which is paired with a glorious Bigsby Licensed B60 vibrato tailpiece. The hardware creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain, whilst the Bigsby offers meticulous control over vibrato.</p><h3> Blacktop Filter'Tron pickups </h3><p>Fitted to the body are two BlackTop Filter'Tron humbuckers in the neck and bridge positions. Designed to enhance the """"fat"""" timbre produced by the body, this pair produce an enviable tonal arsenal for you to play with. The neck position enhances the plucky articulation of the neck and fingerboard, whilst the bridge pickup draws more from the body, generating a thunderous charge when you want it.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of a three-way pickup selector toggle switch, which allows you to select either pickup independently or select both outputs simultaneously for a fuller tone. Each pickup has an independent volume knob, and both are connected to master volume and tone pots.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gretsch Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,632-632-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/17d7109d21148456450bb02b4dd0a1fa.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"G5420LH Electromatic Hollowbody Left-Handed - Black","G5420LH Electromatic Hollowbody Left-Handed - Black",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Through a combination of vintage-style and updated technology, Gibson has captured the vibrant energy and character of a classic Les Paul, whilst exceeding the tonal demands of today's guitarists.</p><h3>Sleek Les Paul design</h3><p>As you'd expect, the body is crafted using classic combination of two-piece mahogany that has been combined with a grade A plain maple top. The mahogany has been treated to a 9-hole weight relief rout, which makes the body lighter and easier to wield, without losing any of that raw Les Paul power. The maple doesn't just look pretty either; it lends itself to a sweetly delivered high-end that allows this beauty to truly sparkle. The body protected by a smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer, which preserves that natural grain and paintwork to allow your Les Paul to age gracefully.</p><h3>Single-piece mahogany neck</h3><p>To create a confident playing feel, Gibson have fitted a single-piece mahogany neck using a solid mortise and tenon joint reinforced using Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive. You can rest assured that no matter how hard you play, the neck is built with durability at its heart. Thanks to its slimtaper profile, the neck is delightfully slender and accommodating most player's hands with ease.</p><p>Married to the neck is a heavenly rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. Cream binding along the fingerboard ensures seamless transitions between frets, whilst the standard 12-inch radius makes it a breeze to perform smooth string bends.</p><h3>Zebra '57 Classic humbuckers</h3><p>To create a tonal match for the sophisticated '60s/'70s aesthetic, the Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar is equipped with a Zebra '57 Classic in the neck position, and a Zebra '57 Classic Plus in the bridge. The depth and warmth of the mahogany is given the commanding presence it deserves, with a hearty mid to low-end energy flowing from the pickups, thanks to the wound Alnico II magnet-driven humbuckers. The crispness of the maple rings truly, offering a snappy counterpoint to the dense mahogany.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes via the pickup independent volume and tone controls, which allow you to sculpt and shape your tone with precision. Orange Drop capacitors ensure that the slightest of adjustments is executed as smoothly as possible, putting absolute tone control in your hands.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>The headstock is home to Grover's zamak locking tuners with an impressive 14:01 tuning ratio, so you can rest assured that no slipping will occur during any emphatic string bending. The strings meet the body via the nickel-plated zamak ABR bridge and nickel-plated aluminium stop bar tailpiece. From the tuning machines down to the tailpiece, everything is designed and fitted to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>Each Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar model is supplied with a classic Gibson hardshell case in brown to protect your pride and joy whether it is in storage or in transit. With the 2017 model you will also receive a Gibson USA multi tool, premium strap, polishing cloth, and owner's manual to help you to keep your Les Paul in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,461-461-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/953dc943e0573f1e04de29ce763a6f39.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar - Gold Top","Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar - Gold Top",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

This gorgeous 12-string includes all the customary appointments you'd expect to see on a Taylor, with some fine touches that make this guitar truly unique. The Taylor 150E is built to the dreadnought body shape, giving it a solid mid to low-end power. The back and sides of the body are crafted from sapele laminate, reinforcing the lower-end charge. The laminate responds well to changes in temperature and humidity, making it very useful for those who like their guitar to travel with them wherever they go. The top is made from Sitka spruce - a favourite of Taylor's -, which has excellent resonant qualities. This allows it to project a loud sound with the utmost clarity. The top is reinforced by Taylor's 100 Series 12-string bracing, giving it more than adequate support whilst also allowing it to resonate fully.</p><p>For times when you are playing to a large crowd and need a bit more power, the 150E is fitted with Taylor's awesome Expression System. The all-magnetic acoustic guitar pickup system amplifies the natural sound of the 150E, without adding colouration or distortion to the signal. Three simple controls make it very easy to adjust your tone on the go - volume, bass and treble. The neck is made using sapele, which is married to a luxurious ebony fretboard. This neck/fingerboard combination offers a warm response to the crisp brightness of the 12 strings, allowing each and every note to ring out with clear articulation.</p><p>The finishing appointments across the guitar lend themselves beautifully to the stylish aesthetic and solid functionality of the 150E. The Tusq nut and saddle guarantee that string spacing is upheld perfectly, whilst the sustain produced by the strings is maintained beautifully. Die-cast chrome mini tuning machines retain tuning integrity with absolute precision. A decorative three-ring rosette surrounds the soundhole and a black pickguard protects the body below the soundhole from unwanted picks and scrapes.</p><p>The Taylor 150E is an excellent 12-string that offers shimmering notes with a sparkling complexity. If you're looking for a guitar that sounds amazing, looks gorgeous and travels well, then this is the perfect guitar for you.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1027-1027-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/5a67bda331fc140e66ad1df1402b6d42.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 150E 12-String Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 150E 12-String Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Now the guys at Gibson Custom have brought it back with historically accurate appointments to give you a reincarnation that is as close to the original as possible. This was one of the first Gibson sunburst models which has since become legendary and this new version brings it right up to date.</p><h3>MAPLE AND MAHOGANY</h3><p>In 1958 when Gibson first designed the original Les Paul Standard guitars, they would all feature a two-piece maple body top, and the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard indeed has a two-piece figured maple top. Figured maple is instantly eye-catching due to its flame-like texture while it also contributes to producing that vintage, '58 sound of the original.</p><p>The top is accompanied by mahogany in the back and sides which makes for the perfect partnership with the figured maple top to produce a strong, resonant output as authentic as those models which were first released in the late 50s. This version is given the 1950s style Les Paul body contour with no weight relief for a historically correct feel.</p><h3>VINTAGE CORRECT NECK</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard is fitted with a single-piece mahogany neck with a comfortable 1950's style Les Paul profile. It is firmly joined to the body using hot hide-glue which was a constitutional element of the original guitars. The neck also has a historic long-tenon neck joint which enables the guitar to precisely convey its classic tone.</p><p>Aboard the neck is a solid, one-piece Indian rosewood fingerboard which assists the mahogany in providing an all-round Les Paul sound. With 22 frets at your service, you can work your way up and down the neck in confidence thanks to the cellulose Trapezoid inlays.</p><h3>CUSTOM BUCKER PICKUPS</h3><p>Gibson have employed Custom Bucker pickups in the electronics of the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard, and consider them to be their best replica of PAF pickups yet. The Custom Buckers achieve an output that is as close to the original sound of a '58 guitar as you can imagine. Each pickup is powered by Alnico III magnets which deliver you a mix of epic ringing or deep rumble depending on the sound output that you require.</p><p>To help you control the rhythm and lead pickups, the guitar is fitted with two Volume and two Tone pots with matched 500k potentiometers and encased with gold top hats.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard has an ABR bridge with thumbwheels partnered with a lightweight aluminium stop bar tailpiece which enhances the overall intonation and sustain. At the top end of the guitar at the headstock we have reissue Kluson deluxe green keys made with nickel plated steel to uphold tuning integrity with accuracy.</p><p>Protecting the beautiful, hand-sprayed nitrocellulose finish on the body is a 1950's style cream pickguard which also really complements the guitar. The guitar also comes equipped with a reissue Les Paul case with a brown outer and pink fur lining to further protect this wonderful guitar.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,558-558-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/66db231f9c2eef0b283e589d59140e01.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul - Faded Tobacco","Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul - Faded Tobacco",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The slender body with arched top create the perfect resting and playing position for the picking hand, whilst the deep double cutaway clears the way for your fretting hand to access the neck in its entirety. Basswood has been employed as the tonewood of choice, laying the foundation beautifully with a solid midrange energy that is infused with warmth. Paired with the Basswood is a cool quilted maple top, finished in a striking transparent red.</p><h3> Neck-through-body design </h3><p>The true neck-through-body construction has been a feature of Jackson models since 1980, and are revered due to their improved playability and superior sustain. The X Series Soloist maple neck benefits from this construction method, whilst also receiving graphite support rod reinforcement to extend the longevity of the neck's stability for many years to come, no matter what you throw its way on the road.</p><h3> Compound radius fingerboard </h3><p>Jackson pioneered the compound radius fingerboard design, which features a rounded profile at the nut that flattens towards the heel. The benefit of this design lies in its ability to create a more natural playing position for the fretting hand. Whether you're throwing in cheeky string bends, seamless legato or two-handed tapping across multiple strings, the rosewood fingerboard is more than happy to oblige you. Piranha tooth position inlays guide you along each of the 24 jumbo frets in style, whilst the single-ply neck binding offers seamless transitions between each fret.</p><h3> EMG active humbuckers </h3><p>The X Series Soloist is equipped with a pair of EMG active humbuckers in the neck and bridge positions to give this awesome model the beefy power it deserves. Fitted in the neck position is the EMG 85 and an EMG 81 in the bridge, a pairing favoured by many metallers for decades. The 81 offers an impressive sonic assault by making the most of the powerful ceramic magnets that give it incredible detail at ultra-high gain. The 85 offers a more rounded output, but no less impressive, that is fantastic for chunky mid-powered chops and palm-muted chugging. Simply put, there is a reason why so many love this setup, and once you have a go you'll hear why.</p><h3> Floyd Rose precision </h3><p>To ensure optimum intonation and sustain along with peerless vibrato control, Jackson have equipped the body with a Floyd Rose Special double locking 2-point tremolo. Paired with Floyd Rose R3 locking nuts, you can rest assured that once you tune up and lock in, your strings will faithfully adhere to your playing, no matter how punishing it may be.</p><p>To further the stability of the Jackson X Series Soloist SLATXMGQ3-6, Dunlop dual locking strap locks keep you locked-in to prevent the misery of a dropped neck or snapped headstock from holding you back as you rock out - wherever that may be.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Jackson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,923-923-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/2bf1dd9d4c97b93611fca440f5cdfdaf.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Jackson X Series Soloist SLATXMGQ3-6 Electric Guitar - Transparent Red","Jackson X Series Soloist SLATXMGQ3-6 Electric Guitar - Transparent Red",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The sophistication of the body finish, coupled with the sumptuous thinline hollowbody design makes the G5422TG very pleasing on the eye. Whether you're an amateur or a pro, you're bound to turns heads with this gorgeous guitar. As we've come to expect from Gretsch, only the finest appointments are included here, creating a guitar that is versatile in the studio, and resilient enough to cope with anything you can throw its way on the road.</p><h3> Bound double-cutaway body </h3><p>The body is shaped to a thinline hollowbody profile, making it very comfortable to perform with without compromising upon its ability to produce a full-bodied timbre. The 5-ply maple tonewood works perfectly with the body design to lay the foundation for a smooth midrange energy that offers a sweet bottom-end and sparkling yet softly rounded highs. The stylish over-sized bound f-holes that are shaped into the top, allow the acoustic timbre to ease through for a smooth, subtle projection. The top is bound to offer protection to the body edges, as well complementing the masterfully executed finish. Protection is offered to the paintwork in the form of a slender yet resilient gloss finish. A gold plexi pickguard finds its home on the body just below the pickups, proudly displaying a black Gretsch logo.</p><h3> Gloss-finished maple neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a smooth maple neck, which is crafted to a """"U""""-shape profile to create a fast-playing feel. Paired with the neck is a bound, 22-fret rosewood fingerboard that is adorned with pearloid hump-block position inlays. The 12-inch fingerboard radius means that performing string bends is a thankfully comfortable experience. The double-cutaway body profile means that each and every fret is within easy reach.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck you'll find a Graph Tech nubone nut, which works in partnership with the vintage-style open-back tuning machines to stabilise string tension and tuning integrity. Connected to the body is a smaller late-'50s G6120 bound headstock, which proudly shows off a white Gretsch logo. Fitted to the G5422TG is an adjusto-matic bridge with a secured rosewood-base, which is paired with a glorious Bigsby Licensed B60 vibrato tailpiece. The hardware creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain, whilst the Bigsby offers accurate and effortless control over vibrato.</p><h3> Blacktop Filter'Tron pickups </h3><p>Fitted to the body are two BlackTop Filter'Tron humbuckers in the neck and bridge positions. Designed to enhance the """"fat"""" timbre produced by the body, this pair produce an enviable tonal arsenal for you to play with. The neck position enhances the plucky articulation of the neck and fingerboard, whilst the bridge pickup draws more from the body, generating a thunderous charge when you want it.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of a three-way pickup selector toggle switch, which allows you to select either pickup independently or select both outputs simultaneously for a fuller tone. Each pickup has an independent volume knob, and both are connected to master volume and tone pots.</p><p>The Gretsch G5422TG Electromatic hollowbody guitar with Bigsby tailpiece is a divine model that is a joy to perform with.

The fingerboard hosts 24 frets, meaning you have a two-octave fretboard to explore fully. Offset white dot inlays decorate the frets to guide you along.</p> <h3>Quantum Pickups</h3> <p>The S670QM Spot Run is powered by a superb trio of Quantum pickups. The neck and bridge positions feature ceramic humbucking Quantum pickups, while the middle position employs an Alnico-powered Quantum single-coil pickup. The fusion of humbuckers and a single-coil pickup opens up a whole universe of tones, whether you're tearing out solos or using their responsive bass / midrange tones for complex chording.</p> <p>Master Volume and Tone controls allow you to shape your sound with precision, while a 5-way pickup switch blends and separates the pickups.</p> <h3>Hardware and Finish</h3> <p>The S670QM is fitted with an excellent Edge-Zero II tremolo bridge with a stud lock function that improves tuning stability even after plenty of heavy tremolo use. The tuners at the headstock also work alongside the bridge to ensure that each string remains in tune.</p> <p>The spectacular finish of this Spot Run model is matched up with Cosmo Black hardware. The S670QM Spot Run is yet another high quality electric guitar hailing from the Ibanez S line of first-rate instruments to appeal to the masses.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Ibanez Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,821-821-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/68e8f60e9583e043e70dc2b71eb05242.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Ibanez S670QM Electric Guitar - Sapphire Blue","Ibanez S670QM Electric Guitar - Sapphire Blue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Gibson have got the perfect mix of """"tradition and innovation"""", combining original, time-honoured appointments with some incredible upgrades to attract modern players.</p><h3>BODY</h3><p>As with the majority of Gibson electric guitars, the 2017 SG Standard HP has a mahogany body. One of the most radical features of the SG when it was first released was the double cutaway body, which is still the same today. The SG Standard HP is equipped with a fast access heel for exceptional, easy reach to every fret, further boosted by the double cutaway.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>A smooth, Soloist mahogany neck is fitted to the SG Standard HP, providing extra room to play with. The neck has a Slim Taper profile, a popular choice for those who have a preference towards a much faster playing style.</p><p>The neck is topped with a sumptuous, dark rosewood fingerboard with a 12 inch radius and 22 easy-to-reach frets. Classic Mother of Pearl trapezoid inlays decorate the frets, guiding you from one to the next with complete confidence. For unrestricted control over string action and better sustain there is a titanium zero-fret adjustable nut with locking feature.</p><h3>ELECTRONICS</h3><p>Gibson have employed a pair of classic humbucker pickups in the 2017 SG Standard HP, with a '57 Classic in the neck position and a '57 Classic + in the bridge position. The '57 Classic humbuckers are designed to accurately replicate the original PAF-style tone heard on the original SG models many years ago.</p><p>The controls follow suit on previous models, with four knobs for rhythm and lead Volume and Tone, plus a 3-way pickup toggle switch to shape your SG sound. With upgraded wiring for the 2017 model, the controls work brilliantly to offer the desired tone you're looking for. The chrome-plated knobs and switch tip are designed to improve grip, so even on a dark, hot stage you'll have no problem making adjustments.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>There is updated, modern chrome hardware featured on the SG Standard HP, from the bell-shaped truss rod cover, tuning keys, Gibson logo and crown on the headstock to the bridge, tailpiece and control knobs. The headstock is now fitted with an improved version of the G FORCE automatic tuning system. Retuning your strings is a doddle with this accurate system, plus it has been calibrated to prevent any unwanted noise or interference.</p><p>A traditional chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge is fitted to the lower bout of the body with titanium saddles joined by an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece with locking studs for top quality sustain and resonance.</p><p>The small teardrop pickguard is designed to both protect and complement the stunning finish of the SG Standard HP, while the white fingerboard binding on the neck also helps complete the look. Gibson include a premium Gibson aluminium hard case, strap and polishing cloth with the purchase of a 2017 SG Standard HP, enabling the new owner to keep it in the finest condition for years to come.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,483-483-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/d3e9ea98fe0b7357134472d81e560c7c.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 SG Standard HP Electric Guitar","Gibson 2017 SG Standard HP Electric Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Whether you're looking for a guitar that yields to gentle fingerstyle playing or flatpicking, the 0001XAE can capably handle anything you throw at it.</p><p>The solid sitka spruce top is secured using an a-frame """"X-1"""" bracing pattern that gives it protection from buckling over time increasing the longevity of the top's reverberant qualities. The high-pressure laminate back and sides add depth to the lighter tonal qualities of the spruce, which means that although the body shape maybe smaller than a traditional dreadnought, it is capable of producing a high sonic output across the frequency spectrum. The high-pressure laminate also handles humidity and temperature changes very well, making it an excellent choice for touring artists who want a roadworthy workhorse.</p><p>The neck is cut to the modified low oval profile, allowing it to be cradled nicely with the fretting hand. The neck is constructed from rust stratabond. This is a dye impregnated wood veneer that has exceptional strength and durability, making it a perfect neck wood. A lightweight richlite fingerboard is home to 20 frets across a generous 25.4"""" scale length.</p><p>The 000X1AE comes fitted with the Fishman Sonitone electronics system, which contains an active soundhole-mounted preamp with a 1/4"""" input jack as well as volume and tone controls. The Tone control can be attenuated to help deliver a thicker or punchier sound, help drop out the midrange when finger-picking and add more depth and articulation for times when you want to strum hard.</p><p>Chrome enclosed tuning machines ensure that each string's tuning integrity is maintained throughout each performance and the black richlite bridge ensures their connection to the body is robustly guaranteed, giving you utter confidence in the guitar's ability to perform.</p><p>The body is protected beneath the soundhole by a decorative and functional tortoise colour pickguard, reducing the chances of nicking or scraping the sitka spruce whilst playing.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Martin Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,939-939-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/41cdfb8218fa336a41cc2b192c41d2b8.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Martin 000X1AE Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Martin 000X1AE Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Modelled on designs that were popular in the early half of the 20th century, the G9521 offers outstanding build quality that is comprised of fine tonewoods, gig-ready hardware, and the highest quality appointments. Whether you're looking for a guitar to practise on, gig/record/travel with, this beauty is a bargain at such an affordable price.</p><h3> Sleek auditorium body </h3><p>The Style 2 G9521 triple-0 is shaped to the auditorium body shape, which offers a punchier mid-range emphasis than that of a dreadnought. This is due to the scaled-down dimensions of the guitar's waist, which in turn makes it a very comfortable model for resting on your knee during performances. Though it may be smaller than a dreadnought, it still boasts an impressive dynamic range, and can easily hold its own whether you're performing solo, or accompanying a vocalist/playing as part of an ensemble.</p><p>To ensure a confident mid-range warmth, the body back and sides have been built using laminated mahogany, which also holds up well in coping with changes in humidity and temperature (ideal attributes in a travel-friendly guitar). The top is built from solid spruce, which is a popular choice as a soundboard thanks to its impressive ability to project tones confidently. The top is reinforced using quartersawn X-bracing to prevent unwanted buckling or warping, whilst allowing it to resonate unimpeded.</p><h3> Sturdy mahogany neck </h3><p>Connected to the body is a full-length 24.875-inch mahogany neck, which guarantees a firm and unyielding playing support to perform on. To prevent unwanted stickiness or tackiness from holding you back, a subtle satin finish has been applied to the neck. Shaped to the slim """"C"""" profile, the neck sits comfortably in the hand. Paired with the neck is a 19-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with mother-of-pearl dot inlays to guide you.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>Starting at the headstock, you'll find vintage-style open-back tuning machines, which work dutifully alongside the bone nut to ensure uniform string tension and tuning integrity. The body is home to a rosewood bridge, which anchors each string securely to optimise intonation and sustain. Aged white neck binding traces from the headstock to the body, complementing the exquisite Appalachia Cloudburst finish perfectly.</p><p>The Gretsch Style 2 G9521 Triple-0 Auditorium Acoustic Guitar in Appalachia Cloudburst is great for taking to the stage with, chilling out or jamming with friends, and is ideal for those who want a model that travels well.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gretsch Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,658-658-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/c091be3d286a5de92f3072003a45152c.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Style 2 G9521 Triple-0 Auditorium Guitar - Appalachia Burst","Style 2 G9521 Triple-0 Auditorium Guitar - Appalachia Burst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Don't let the size fool you though. The Taylor GS Mini Mahogany is built to Taylor's uncompromisingly high-standards of quality and can more than hold its own against larger models. </p><p>The top is built using Solid Tropical Mahogany, a dense tonewood that delivers a very bright and punchy sound. The Mahogany top gives a short and snappy tone to the guitar but throughout its life can develop into an incredibly warm and natural soundboard. It is well suited to players who are looking for a tone with plenty of individuality and attitude. </p><p> The back and sides are constructed from Sapele laminate, which is composed of a filler layer between an interior and exterior layer of Sapele laminate. The beauty of employing laminate material in the GS Mini means that it is much more resilient than a solid tonewood when dealing with changes in humidity, making it an excellent guitar to take on your travels. </p><p> The neck has been fashioned from Sapele and fitted with a solid ebony fingerboard that houses 20 highly playable frets. To add an extra layer of protection to the wood the neck, back and sides have all been finished with a varnish. It is durable enough to protect from scratches and rubbing, whilst also being thin enough to allow the wood to resonate without interference.</p><p> The guitar's design is completed with a three ring rosette around the soundboard, chrome buttons and die-cast chrome tuners. A tortoise pickguard also adds protection to the body whilst maintaining the high-quality aesthetic.</p><p>The Taylor GS Mini Acoustic Guitar comes pickup-ready. Get yourself Taylor's ES-Go soundhole pickup and a screwdriver and within a few minutes you can set the guitar up to be plugged into an acoustic amp, recorder or PA system. The GS Mini makes setting up the ES-Go ridiculously easy, as it has all the right clips and holes already in place. As this is a simple pickup system it does not have built-in volume controls so Taylor have also created the V-Cable that allows you to control the volume. You can, of course, use any type of 1/4-inch instrument cable and rely on your own playing to control the volume.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1106-1106-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/c56156366f8467996418d229109f359c.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor GS Mini Mahogany Acoustic Guitar","Taylor GS Mini Mahogany Acoustic Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

For over 180 years, Martin have developed and built truly high quality guitars using their limitless expertise and research. The DRS-2 has tonnes of tonal versatility and feels ultimately durable to play whether you're on stage or not. As always, Martin have employed the best and most sustainable types of tonewood to build the DRS-2 in order to produce an impeccable acoustic sound.</p><h3>DREADNOUGHT BODY</h3><p>The Martin DRS-2 takes on the traditional dreadnought body style which has been well revered and recognised for so many years thanks to its attractive appearance and tonal depth. Martin have employed a solid sitka spruce top for this model and have further reinforced the strength of the soundboard using their A-Frame ''X-1'' bracing technique. The inner bracing also expands the range of tones which the guitar can then produce giving it a fantastic Martin sound.</p><h3>TONEWOODS</h3><p>The back and sides of the DRS-2 are made up of sapele tonewood which is very sustainable and produces a range of strong low ends to more sparkling highs. Firmly joined to the body via a traditional Mortise and Tenon joint is a select hardwood neck that is shaped to a modified low oval profile which feels super easy to play. Accompanying the neck is a black richlite fingerboard with a total of 20 frets, 14 of which are open so you can access the higher notes more easily.</p><h3>FISHMAN SONITONE ELECTRONICS</h3><p>Beneath the soundhole, Martin have fitted the DRS-2 with the Fishman Sonitone preamp. The preamp has subtle volume and tone controls which are easy to adjust under the soundhole to suit your playing needs.

The new left handed version of the 114ce has a Grand Auditorium profile with a Venetian cutaway. Built using excellent materials, the 114ce is a superb guitar that responds to all musical styles making it a great all-rounder to have in your collection.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>The Grand Auditorium body shape was first introduced in 1994 and has remained the first choice for many musicians because it is so multifaceted. The left handed 114ce also has a Venetian cutaway, offering not just a clean sloping appearance but also providing full access to the neck.</p><p>Sitka Spruce is nearly always the choice of tonewood when it comes to making a Taylor acoustic, and this remains true in the 114ce. The top is reinforced with forward shifted pattern bracing which helps the guitar to sing with clarity and volume. The back and sides of the 114ce are made up of layered walnut, an exquisite tonewood which produces a versatile tonal range with deep lows, a punchy midrange and crisp highs.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>The Taylor patented sapele neck has a narrower 1 11/16 inch nut width, facilitating those big bar chords and faster playing methods. An ebony fingerboard tops the neck and is home to 20 frets, and of course you have full access to these thanks to the body's Venetian cutaway. Each fret movement is guided by the 4mm dot Italian acrylic inlays.</p><h3>ES2 Pickup</h3><p>The guitar's natural voice is transferred beautifully via the Expression System 2 pickup. This pickup is like no other due to its unique positioning behind the saddle. It has three individually calibrated sensors, this means that each note can be accurately and clearly heard. The pickup and Taylor's custom-designed """"professional audio""""-grade preamp work together to give the 114ce its excellent acoustic tones. Tweak your sound using the simple controls for Tone and Volume.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>Tuning stability is superb thanks to the chrome tuners fitted to the headstock. The Tusq nut and Micarta saddle also provide durability and enhanced sustain.</p><p>The natural body finish comes with matching neat appointments such as a three-ring soundhole rosette, black pickguard and black binding. Carrying the 114ce is made easy as Taylor include a lightweight protective gig bag with each one.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1025-1025-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/e17b3a37e86e7db96111dfc2910e6690.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 2017 114ce Walnut Left Handed Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 2017 114ce Walnut Left Handed Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Taking on the sophisticated single-cutaway style, but including modern-era appointments, the 2017 Les Paul Traditional T is a dream come true for purists who are seeking a no nonsense model that sounds as good as it looks.</p><h3> Classic Les Paul design </h3><p>In keeping with its predecessors, the 2017 Traditional T adheres strictly to the non-weight relieved Les Paul body design, giving it a weighty feel with a resilient sustain. The tonewood partnership here features a two-piece mahogany back, which is paired with an AA grade maple top. The finish has been treated to a slender yet durable layer of smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer to protect against premature wear.</p><h3> Classic rounded neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body via a classic mortis and tenon joint is the single-piece mahogany neck. Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive has been tasked with reinforcing the neck joint to maximise stability and strength. In keeping with the traditional approach, the neck has been shaped to the rounded profile, which gives the neck a more substantial feel in the hand.</p><p>Married to the neck is a sublime 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. The fingerboard has been increased in thickness, which makes it ideal for those who like to flex their playing muscles. Cream binding traces along the edge of the fingerboard to create seamless transitions between frets.</p><h3> Resilient, stage-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck you'll find the nylon nut, which continues the nod to the Les Paul's heritage whilst guaranteeing exceptional tone, sustain and durability. The headstock is angled to Gibson's customary 17-degrees to improve tuning stability and string tension, whilst the Gibson logo is proudly on display for all to see. The nickel-plated zamak vintage-style keystone tuning machines boast an impressive 14:01 tuning ratio, firmly securing your strings during each and every performance as you rock out.</p><p>The body is home to the aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with titanium saddles and locking thumbwheels, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar with locking studs. The bridge and tailpiece partnership works dutifully to ensure intonation and sustain is optimised so that your Les Paul sings beautifully, and with the richness it deserves.</p><h3>Burstbucker 1 and 2 humbucker pickups</h3><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional T Electric Guitar has been fitted with a Burstbucker 1 and 2 humbuckers, fitted in the neck and bridge positions respectively. The Alnico II-powered Burstbuckers translate the richness of the body tonewoods, and the articulation of the neck and fingerboard construction with impeccable clarity. Control over the pickups comes in the form of classic gold Top Hat knobs, which complement the stunning finish beautifully.Included Accessories</p><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional T Electric Guitar is supplied with its very own Gibson hardshell aluminium case with plush lined interior. Additional accessories include the Gibson USA multi-tool, premium strap, and polishing cloth to keep your new pride and joy in pristine working condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,470-470-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/2cc7555111d20041ef6510772042daee.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional T Electric Guitar - Honey Burst","Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional T Electric Guitar - Honey Burst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Across the tonal spectrum and throughout the dynamic range, the dreadnought-shape executes each note with distinction and clarity. The playing feel is robust and has a familiarity that makes it incredibly comfortable to play.</p><p>The DRSGT body is crafted using solid sapele for the back and sides, partnered up with a solid Sitka spruce top. The sapele generates loads of energy, which creates the thumping driving force that dreadnoughts are known for. The Sitka spruce top acts as the highly resonant soundboard, which projecting sound efficiently so that each and every note rings out truly and transparently.</p><p>Martin's A-frame """"X-1"""" top bracing pattern gives the Sitka spruce top all the support and freedom it needs to resonate fully to project sound efficiently. Thanks to this you have a wide dynamic range at your disposal that allows you to add deft creative texture to your performance.</p><p>A cool black pickguard protects the underside of the strings from unwanted nicks and chips, preserving the integrity of the soundboard for as long as possible. Black boltoran binding ensures the edging between the top and sides is guarded against accidental knocks and lends itself to the guitar's slick overall look.</p><p>The solid sipo neck and black richlite fingerboard create the perfect counterpoint to the powerful body. Your playing style is faithfully honoured thanks to the graceful articulation of each note. The neck has a layer of protection thanks to a gentle satin coating, allowing a fast-playing feel so that moving up and down the neck is an absolute delight.</p><p>The DRSGT comes fitted with the Fishman Sonitone USB electronic system. If you need a bit more power for a larger gig the 1'4"""" jack allows you to hook the guitar up to an amp, or whatever else you fancy. For recording straight into your DAW there is even a USB connection, making it even easier to get your songs down.</p><p>The black richlite bridge guarantees a seamless connection between your strings and the body - adding to the excellent sustain properties. Chrome enclosed tuning machines with small buttons carry out the task of maintaining tuning integrity with absolute precision, allow you to play exactly how you want to with total reassurance.</p><p>The Martin DRSGT is powerful electro acoustic that gives you a complete touring, recording guitar in one. If you're looking for a high-quality, versatile guitar then you've found it. You even get a Martin 345 hardshell case to carry it around in, so as soon as it arrives you're good to go!</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Martin Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,975-975-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/ea8c7a1ac803a4904546ce2ae18726f3.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Martin Road Series DRSGT Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Martin Road Series DRSGT Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The X Series merged together all of the quality expected from any Martin guitar but at less of a cost so that more guitarists can take advantage of the Martin range. The DX1KAE has a Martin dreadnought body profile which has been put together using a range of fine materials to produce the Martin acoustic timbre we know and love.</p><h3>DREADNOUGHT BODY PROFILE</h3><p>The Martin DX1KAE has a D-14 platform and has the conventional dreadnought body frame to enable the guitar to produce a full sustain and a range of versatile tones. Martin have employed solid sitka spruce for the body top which is further strengthened by the A-Frame ''X-1'' bracing technique. This bracing not only adds stability to the guitar but expands the range of tones considerably. Martin designed the dreadnought body template many years ago but it is increasingly well-regarded as time goes on due to its fantastic sound and attractive appearance.</p><h3>TONEWOODS</h3><p>Hawaiian Koa is used to construct the back and sides of the DX1KAE because of its ability to resonate but also due to its striking natural pattern. The Koa has been high pressure laminated and given a clear coating for added protection. Securely joining the body by means of a traditional Mortise and Tenon joint is a birch laminate neck with a modified low oval shape for easy playability. A 20-fret black richlite fingerboard sits atop of the neck at a 25.4 inch scale length and feels wonderful to play, even for more complicated movements. It's worth noting that 14 of the 20 frets are open unlike many other acoustic guitars, so you can take advantage of those higher notes easily to the top of the neck.</p><h3>FISHMAN SONITONE ELECTRONICS</h3><p>Underneath the soundhole, Martin have included a Fishman Sonitone preamp. The preamp has subtle volume and tone controls which are easy to adjust under the soundhole to suit your playing needs. The Fishman Sonitone pickup does a great job of translating the sparkling acoustic sounds and tones of your guitar when plugged in.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The Martin DX1KAE has small chrome tuning keys to uphold tuning integrity with precision and accuracy, and the black richlite bridge ensures a solid connection with the strings which means you can perform with confidence.</p><p>Beneath the soundhole is a tortoise pickguard to not only protect the body from scratches but to give the natural hand-rubbed urethane finish a contrast in appearance.</p><p>The Martin DX1KAE is an outstanding electro acoustic guitar which has a huge tonal range and deep sound all at an affordable price.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Martin Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,956-956-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/7e8ff33ab48ce8c501b3d8e4873f7635.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Martin DX1KAE Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Martin DX1KAE Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The BTe-Koa follows on from Taylor's previous Baby Taylor models, all of which are considered to be some of the world's best travel guitars thanks to their comfortable, compact sizing. Travelling musicians will be major fans of the BTe-Koa thanks to its unique voicing and versatile playability.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>The BTe-Koa retains the ever-popular dreadnought body shape and condenses it into a 3/4 size acoustic guitar. Despite the guitar's smaller size, that is not to say that its sound is compromised as a result, quite the contrary in fact. The body of the Baby Taylor has been made entirely from Koa tonewood which looks and sounds just sublime. Koa is a wood found in Hawaii and is quite the rarity in the world of guitar construction. The all-Koa body contributes an incredible tonal warmth yet also has a delicious, striking appearance. For reinforced strength and dependability, the soundboard features unique X-bracing.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>A tropical American mahogany neck is firmly fitted to the all-Koa body and has a slightly shorter 22 3/4 inch scale length, facilitating a faster playing technique. The neck is topped with a 19-fret ebony fingerboard which features pearloid dot inlays as a decorative guide, so you can move up and down the neck with confidence.</p><h3>Expression System Baby Electronics</h3><p>In order to amplify the BTe-Koa, Taylor have equipped it with the brilliant Expression System Baby (ES-B) onboard preamp / pickup. The onboard electronics can be described as including primary appointments of the Taylor Expression System 2 piezo pickup along with the addition of a very convenient digital chromatic tuner. You can make subtle tweaks to your sound using the simple Volume and Tone controls. When it is not in use for over three minutes, the ES-B preamp can switch itself off to save battery power and improve efficiency.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>The headstock is fitted with enclosed die-cast chrome plated tuning machines, upholding tuning integrity with precision. Sustain and intonation is improved thanks to a Tusq nut and saddle combined with the ebony bridge. Each BTe-Koa comes with a gig bag, an absolute must-have accessory for any travelling musician.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1116-1116-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/0b90daaddf7935c22479aa811cb40086.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor BTe-Koa Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor BTe-Koa Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Balancing this out are the solid African ovangkol back &amp; sides, which, although similar to rosewood, offers a fuller mid range. The top is gloss finished, while the back &amp; sides have been satin finished. A white binding and a tortoise pickguard finish things off nicely.</p><p>Joined to the body of the Taylor 414E Guitar is a satin-finished tropical mahogany neck. Topping this is a 20-fret ebony fingerboard with progressive dot inlays, sitting between a Tusq nut and saddle.</p><h3>Electronics</h3><p>Amplifying the natural sound of the Taylor 414E Electro Acoustic is Taylor's own onboard acoustic pickup and preamp pairing, the Expression System.

Taylor have years of guitar-building experience and knowledge, and are always trying to improve their models to keep up with the fast-paced, changing needs of artists and musicians all over the world. The left handed version of the 110e retains the quintessential dreadnought shape and blends it with high quality tonewoods and electronics for an excellent sound and feel.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>As mentioned, the 110e has a traditional non-cutaway dreadnought body profile, symmetrical and slick in appearance. Regardless of your preferred guitar-playing technique, the dreadnought can adjust to all of them, from hard picking to heavy strumming.</p><p>As with so many Taylor acoustics, the body top is constructed from Sitka Spruce due to its versatility and elasticity when it is played. The top features the Forward Shifted bracing pattern to reinforce the guitar. The Sitka Spruce is paired with layered walnut back and sides which produce a superb range of crisp highs, a punchy midrange and deep lows.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>The neck has a narrow 1 11/16 inch nut width which provides a slim feel in the hand, facilitating bar chords and faster playability. An ebony fingerboard hosts 20 frets on top of the neck with 4mm dot Italian acrylic inlays as a handy guide.</p><h3>ES2 Pickup</h3><p>The excellent Taylor Expression System 2 pickup system powers the amplified sound of the left handed 110e Walnut. This features the patented behind-the-saddle pickup design with three uniquely placed and individually calibrated pickup sensors. This exclusive design works with Taylor's custom """"professional audio""""-grade preamp to produce a responsive, full-bodied voice. Whether you're plugged into an amp or PA system, the 110e will sound just excellent by using the simple Tone and Volume controls.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>As you would expect with any Taylor guitar, the 110e is fitted with top quality hardware. Chrome tuners uphold tuning integrity with precision via the headstock, while a Tusq nut and Micarta saddle enhance sustain. To complete the look, the body has a black pickguard and decorative three ring soundhole rosette. For any passionate acoustic fan, the Taylor 110e Walnut has a beautiful combination of materials and craftsmanship for a wonderfully enjoyable playing experience.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1019-1019-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/e52ca8ed9745078efd13862045a44ed6.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 2017 110e Walnut Left Handed Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 2017 110e Walnut Left Handed Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Having built an outstanding reputation for creating flawless instruments that are as beautiful to look at as they are to play and hear, Taylor consistently pushes the boundaries and strives for perfection with every model they create. This particular version of the 812ce joins the neck with the body at the 12th fret as oppose to the 14th. As a result, the bridge is further back on the soundboard which delivers a deep, rich vintage tone with suprising projection from such a compact guitar.</p><p>The Taylor 812ce 12 Fret's body back and sides have been crafted from Indian rosewood, a delightfully rich and complex tonewood that produces a full and robust mid to low-end force. The top is made from Sitka spruce - a Taylor favourite - due to its excellent resonant properties that enable it to project huge sounds with the greatest of ease. The bright-sounding spruce works in harmony with the body to deliver inspirational tone and projection.</p><p>A gloss finish has been given to the body to protect from unwanted nicks and scrapes that could otherwise occur over the years. It also enables the guitar to cope with changes in humidity and temperature capably, making this a fantastic touring and gigging partner. On this model Taylor have created an even slimmer coating of gloss - down from 6mm to 3.5mm - without sacrificing on its protective abilities.</p><p>The neck is carefully crafted using a tropical mahogany, giving it an unquestionably sturdy feel in the hand. Married to the mahogany is a sumptuous smoked ebony fingerboard, giving a delightful surface to navigate along. The mahogany and ebony combine perfectly to create a highly resonant platform for the strings, guaranteeing that every note rings out with sparkling clarity. The neck has been treated to newly designed Mother-of-Pearl Element position inlays.</p><p>The Taylor 812ce 12 Fret benefits from Taylor's newly designed Expression System 2 (ES2). As part of their never-ending quest for better tone, they shifted their usual 'under-the-saddle' design as they found that by placing the pickup behind the saddle, a less brittle, brash and synthetic sound could be captured. This means that no matter how aggressively you play, the natural warmth produced by the tonewoods rings out beautifully without colouring the signal or blemishing the natural timbre of the 812ce.</p><p>The control layout features the same volume and tone control knobs as on the original Expression System, with Taylor changing the gain structure of the preamp slightly to make it a little hotter. When playing live, this subtle adjustment gives the 812e 12-fret the boost you need to be heard loud and clear.</p><p>Because the, 812ce 12 Fret Electro Acoustic is a guitar you are going to want to keep in peak condition over the years, Taylor have even included a brown Taylor branded deluxe hardcase making this one of the best packages out there for the most discerning of guitarists.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1095-1095-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/5efc91bc6d266b45f4707b3650b4200f.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 812ce 12 Fret Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 812ce 12 Fret Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

It is built using tonewoods of the highest quality and plays host to a wealth of beautiful finishing touches.</p><p>The Taylor 320e has been built with a dreadnought body shape, which is noted for its ability to project a powerful sound. It responds well over a wide dynamic range, boosting the signal of gentler players and yielding a high quality of articulation to more aggressive strummers and pickers. This makes the dreadnought shape perfect for big hitters who want a guitar that will accentuate their sound, rather than drown it out.</p><p>The top wood is built using solid tropical mahogany, a dense tonewood that delivers a very bright and punchy sound. The mahogany top gives a short and snappy tone to the guitar but throughout its life can develop into an incredibly warm and natural soundboard. It is well suited to players who are looking for a tone with plenty of individuality and attitude. The top is reinforced with forward-shifted bracing that features Taylor's patented relief rout. The relief rout allows the stiff mahogany to resonate with greater flexibility, without sacrificing structural integrity.</p><p>The back and side wood of the 320e is built using West African sapele, which has been utilised by Taylor for over a decade. Sapele is known for having similar harmonic qualities to mahogany in delivering soothing lows and warm mid tones. It is a very-adaptable tonewood that supports a variety of styles from fingerstyle to strumming.</p><p>The combination of the mahogany top and sapele back and sides creates a guitar with a high degree of low-end depth that is matched with a bright and snappy upper midrange. The body is bound in black to protect the edges from chips and damage. A black pickguard protects the top of the body beneath the strings from unwanted scratches and scrapes.</p><p>The neck is constructed from reassuringly unyielding tropical mahogany, which is set to a 25-1/2"""" scale length. Coupled with an ebony fingerboard - that is home to 20 frets - the sonic properties of both woods marry together beautifully to complete the delivery of superbly resonant tones with the softened mid range.</p><p>The strings are held in tune by Taylor's reliable chrome tuners, and meet the body via the Tusq nut and saddle who both ensure string action is acutely maintained.</p><h3>Electronics</h3><p>Taylor have done their utmost to ensure that the unique acoustics and timbre of the guitar are as closely represented as possible when it is plugged-in, as to when it is played acoustically. To guarantee this, Taylor spent several years working in collaboration with renowned audio pioneer Rupert Neve to design and perfect their groundbreaking Expression System ? (ES). </p><p>The ES is an all-magnetic acoustic guitar pickup that sits near the soundboard, which acts like a microphone to a produce an exact representation of the acoustics of the guitar. The ES is incredibly simple to command by using the onboard system comprised of three simple controls</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1069-1069-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/5dbd665bbbbee2133dbce68ea527602a.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 320e Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 320e Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Unlike the Les Paul, the SG has a double cutaway, innovative for its time, and it was met with instant fame. The 2017 SG Standard Traditional model remains the leader of the modern SG range, combining quintessential SG sound and appearance with up-to-date appointments and playing feel.</p><h3>BODY</h3><p>The most recognisable feature of the Gibson SG is its double-horned cutaway body, a feature which made it stand out among previous Gibson guitars at the time of its creation. In line with history, the 2017 SG Standard T body is constructed from mahogany, a popular choice of tonewood for the Gibson luthiers thanks to its superb sound delivery.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>A single-piece mahogany neck is securely joined to the body via a traditional Mortis and Tenon joint using the most reliable Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive. The neck is shaped to the Slim Taper profile, offering faster, more comfortable playability.</p><p>The neck is topped with a 12 inch radius rosewood fingerboard with 22 frets, all are readily available thanks to the body's double cutaway. The rosewood is thicker than usual, contributing to the overall sonic depth of the SG. The frets are also decorated with traditional white trapezoid inlays to guide you. Gibson have included a Tektoid nut that is self-lubricating for a better return to pitch and improved sustain.</p><h3>CLASSIC HUMBUCKERS</h3><p>The 2017 SG Standard T is kitted out with a pair of '57 Classic humbucker pickups powered by the outstanding Alnico II magnets.

Since it was released back in the 1960s, many musical pioneers have chosen the Hummingbird as their go-to acoustic, including none other than Keith Richards, which has ensured its worthy place in the annals of folk and rock music. With select modern appointments enhancing the awesome playability of the Hummingbird, this is truly a breath-taking model for all players.</p><h3>Classic Hummingbird body</h3><p>The Hummingbird was the first square-shoulder dreadnought that Gibson released, which combined powerful projection with comfortable playability to perfection. The robust design was matched by an elegantly shaped body that has the ability to generate a powerful sonic blast when the strings are strummed hard, but delivers an equally sweet timbre when fingerpicked. Whether you're a solo performer or playing as part of an ensemble, the Hummingbird can confidently hold its own.</p><p>The body back and sides are built from solid mahogany, which works beautifully with the dreadnought body shape to generate warmth and power.</p><p>The top is crafted using a thermally cured Sitka spruce, which employs a technique that enables Gibson to replicate the aging process with peerless precision. The result is a soundboard that closely replicates the classic Hummingbird in sound and appearance. Radiused scalloped bracing is used to reinforce the top, whilst also optimising projection and resonance. To accentuate the glorious vintage cherry sunburst finish, 6-ply binding has been employed that encircles the tonewood.</p><h3>Solid rounded neck</h3><p>A mahogany neck is firmly fitted to the body via the compound dovetail joint for improved resonance. The neck is shaped to a round profile, offering a smooth playing feel. Aboard the neck is a rosewood fingerboard, presenting you with 20 frets and decorated beautifully with Mother-of-Pearl parallelogram inlays.</p><p>The neck and fingerboard feel more comfortable than ever thanks to the softened fingerboard edge which is designed to fit perfectly in the hand. Gibson have gone the extra mile to make this limited-edition Hummingbird feel like the best acoustic playing surface, and this is a result of the German-engineered, hand-finished Plek technology used in the construction of all Gibson acoustics.</p><h3>Hardware and Finish</h3><p>The lower bout of the Hummingbird is fitted with a traditional belly up rosewood bridge, and like the fingerboard, the bridge is treated with a new finishing oil which gets right into the wood to ensure that it will last even longer. The headstock of the Hummingbird is equipped with gold Gotoh tuning keys, accurately maintaining the tuning of each string in conjunction with the bone saddle. The body is adorned with a vintage pickguard is detailed with a hand painted design, adding to the heavenly finish.</p><p>The Gibson Acoustic 2017 Hummingbird Vintage Acoustic Guitar in Vintage Cherry Sunburst is supplied with a protective brown hardshell case with each purchase, as well as a Gibson Acoustic Owner's Manual, and a certificate of authenticity.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,515-515-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/aa51f483bd0b3ab0b5cfcd145c0fb0a4.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Acoustic Hummingbird Vintage Guitar - Vintage Cherry Sunburst","Gibson Acoustic Hummingbird Vintage Guitar - Vintage Cherry Sunburst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

IF you're still looking for power and rich tonal projection in a smaller body profile, then the Big Baby is the model for you.</p><h3> Scaled-down Dreadnought, Scaled-up Travel Guitar</h3><p>As a 15/16-scale dreadnought, the Taylor Big Baby left-handed delivers the solid projection and robust timbre that you'd expect from a dreadnought, full of clarity and articulation. However, its more portable dimensions means that this is a model that is built to travel with you, wherever your music takes you. The exact dimensions of the instrument are: Body Length: 19 1/2"""", Body Width: 15"""", Body Depth: 4"""". As with the Baby, this model has an arched back to provide additional strength and to increase the capacity of its tonal output.</p><h3> Classic Taylor Tonewood Selections </h3><p>The top has been crafted using solid Sitka spruce - a Taylor favourite that can be seen across many series of models -, a tonewood that is noted for its broad dynamic range that delivers an impressive projection. Sitka spruce also generates crisp articulation throughout the frequency range, ensuring that the Big Baby is versatile enough to turn its hand to whatever you wish to play. The top is reinforced using Taylor's original X bracing pattern. This form of bracing gives the guitar a continuous flow of strength from the upper, to the lower bout, ensuring the soundboard is provided with continuous rigidity and strength.</p><p>The spruce is partnered with layered sapele back and sides, comprised of a core layer of poplar, sandwiched between layers of sapele veneer. Joining layered woods with solid, allows for a guitar that is great in sound but has additional resilience to changes in environment and humidity, whilst remaining affordable and beautiful.</p><h3>Finish and Gig Bag</h3><p>It is the woods selected for the construction of the Taylor Big Baby left-handed acoustic guitar, along with its portable size and comfortable playability that makes it such a great all-rounder. The understated natural finish is coupled with robust yet slender coatings of varnish to preserve the finish for as long as possible. You'll find hard to put it down once you pick it up; fortunately you'll never have to be without it, as it comes supplied with a Taylor gigbag.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1112-1112-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/063634bcbfaaa43c3b79387a8cb37a6a.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor Big Baby Taylor Left-Handed Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor Big Baby Taylor Left-Handed Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The Taylor 210ce is a full-size dreadnought electro-acoustic guitar that features a glossy solid Sitka spruce top, gorgeous rosewood laminate back and sides, and a Venetian cutaway, for full fingerboard access. The dreadnought blueprint used in the construction of the Taylor 210ce Electro Acoustic Guitar provides players with power over their performance. Possibly the most popular guitar shape in the world, this design is so used because of its capacity to project high volume, with clarity and articulation. For this reason it has become the go-to instrument for flatpickers and strummers alike, though it is versatile enough to be picked up by players of varying style and genres.</p><p>The Taylor 210ce Electro Acoustic Guitar takes this design and decks it out with another classic in the acoustic guitar world, a solid Sitka spruce top. This has been popularised because of the brightness, clarity, and broad dynamic range that it brings to a guitar's tone. Joining this, at the back and sides, is a stunning rosewood laminate. Although not as tonally complex as its solid-wood countered part, this layered wood is comprised of a poplar core, sandwiched between interior and exterior layers of rosewood. This brings its own contribution to the overall tone of the instrument, whilst keeping the price down and durability high.</p><p>The sapele neck goes perfect with the Venetian cutaway style, allowing you to glide effortlessly down the neck. This strong and hardwearing neck wears an ebony fingerboard, which provides a smooth-to-the-touch feel and quick and easy transitioning.</p><h3>Taylor ES-T Electronics</h3><p>Plug in with the Taylor ES-T under-saddle transducer pickup and take your performance to the stage with confidence. This pickup system features a custom-voiced EQ, dynamic response, and a phase switch for feedback control, all powered by a 9-volt battery.

It is an absolute joy to play and produces tones to die for.</p><h3> Body </h3><p>The arched top, back and sides of the body are built using ever reliable maple, a dense, hard and heavy tonewood that produces extremely bright, precise tones with tight lows and a very delicate output. Running along the full length of the body is a spruce centre block, that allows the hollow body to resist resonant-frequency feedback. Therefore, when gain is applied to the signal - through the pickups - it can be accurately controlled to produce a sweet tone.</p><p>The spruce and maple combine to give excellent tonal clarity so that each and every note rings out with distinction. The body's finish is protected by a thin but extremely durable coating of urethane. This way the tonewood can resonate without any hindrance to deliver a much fuller sound with tonnes of character. To complete the incredibly classy finish - as well as offer a greater level of protection against knocks and scrapes -, the body and sound holes are neatly bound.</p><h3> Neck </h3><p>The maple neck combined with the rosewood fingerboard, compliments the maple and spruce in the body by gently smoothing out any harsh edges in the upper frequency range whilst slightly compressing and firming out the lower frequencies. It produces dynamic mids that have a snappy attack with plenty of punch when played hard, but excellent clarity when played light and soft. Combined with the 22 fret rosewood fingerboard, this produces a sweetly softened and warmer sound.</p><p>The fingerboard is cut to a very comfortable 12.5 inch radius that rests sweetly in the hand and is absolutely perfect for string bends without the unwanted fret buzz. Classic white pearloid neo-classic """"Thumbnail"""" position inlays guide your way as you play.</p><h3> Electronics </h3><p>The G5620T features a Black Top Filter'Tron pickup in the bridge position and a dual-coil SUPER HiLo'Tron pickup in the neck position. The Black Top mini-humbucker in the bridge delivers wave after wave of power, perfect for those looking for a guitar to rock out on. The dual-coil Super HiLo'Tron represents the high-end frequency output perfectly with shimmering, golden tones being projected with absolute clarity, perfect for choppy jazz licks.</p><h3> Hardware </h3><p>The anchored adjusto-matic bridge ensures the strings' connection to the body is guaranteed throughout each and every performance giving you complete reassurance whilst you play. The much loved Bigsby-license B70 vibrato tailpiece allows you to add your own unique style. Tuning integrity is maintained thanks to the excellent Grover die cast tuners across the headstock.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gretsch Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,657-657-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/05d1ee9a28bc8887b71c5b209db39db6.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"G5620T-CB Electric Guitar","G5620T-CB Electric Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

An all-solid construction, the body of the Martin 000-16GT Acoustic Guitar consists of a solid sitka spruce top &amp; solid genuine mahogany back &amp; sides. Though small the 000-16GT is still loud with the spruce top offering plenty of projection, with a crisp, clear sound, enforced by the mahogany body, which also brings extra focus to the mid range.</p><p>The guitar's top has been strengthened with a hybrid ''X'' scalloped bracing pattern with solid sitka spruce braces.

The composition of tonewoods, construction methods, select hardware, finishing appointments and electronics, come together beautifully to create a guitar that is an absolute dream. The Grand Symphony body shape of the 716ce is very similar to that of Taylor's incredibly popular Grand Auditorium shape. However, the subtle difference lies in the larger lower bout and slightly wider waist, which gives the 716ce a phenomenal amount of power. The fullness of tone, the level of volume and lengthiness of sustain, is great whether you're a hard-hitting strummer or a gentle fingerpicker. Furthermore the 716ce gives you easy access to the upper frets thanks to the masterfully-designed, softly rounded Venetian cutaway.</p><h3>GRAND SYMPHONY CUTAWAY BODY</h3><p>The body top is reinforced using Taylor's performance bracing pattern with relief rout. The relief rout allows the top to reverberate freely, whilst remaining supported at all times. This gives the guitar its great ability to project sound efficiently and loudly.</p><p>Supporting the versatility and volume of the Taylor 716ce Guitar's body shape, a Lutz spruce has been utilised for its response - it accentuates note articulation across the dynamic range. Lutz spruce is a mix of Sitka and White spruce, thus offering you all the best features of these two tonewoods resulting in what is similar to Adirondack spruce. This means plenty of power in the form of volume and great projection.</p><p>The versatility of both body shape and top wood are supported further by the Indian rosewood chosen for the guitar's back &amp; sides, with its responsiveness to any type of playing and its powerful dexterity throughout the entire sonic range.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>The choice of beautiful woods continues with the tropical mahogany used for the Taylor 716ce's neck, topped by a 20-fret ebony fingerboard, which is adorned with Abalone Reflections inlays.</p><p>The Taylor 716ce has been gloss finished in a stunning natural colour. The neck has received a satin finish, allowing you to effortlessly glide along as you play. Offsetting the body finish is an ivoroid binding, which continues along the fingerboard to offer further stability and support.</p><h3>ELECTRONICS</h3><p>Amplifying the natural sound of the 716ce, is Taylor's own onboard acoustic pickup and preamp pairing, the Expression System 2.</p><p>The focal feature of the Expression 2 System (ES2)electronics is the patented behind-the-saddle design. Three piezo sensors are uniquely placed under the saddle at the bridge, which captures more acoustic tone and consequently ensures the natural tones of the 716ce are retained when amplified. What's more with the Expression System 2 being built by Taylor it works seamlessly with their guitars. Controlling the electronics is easy with a set of non-intrusive knobs, made up of Volume and Tone controls. The ES2 preamp is similar to that of the predecessor, but has an updated gain structure which brings it in line with other similar pickups. The onboard ES2 enables you to plug in and play without any fuss.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The Taylor 716CE has an ebony bridge with a tusq nut and micarta saddle, which provides optimum sustain and resonance.</p><p>A weathered brown pickguard complements the clean, Natural gloss finish while also protecting the soundboard against scratches.</p><p>A Taylor Deluxe Hardshell brown case is included to protect the 716CE against damage for years to come, so you can carry it away with confidence.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1033-1033-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/0f66651e9f434d00e35a110ec1c7d1d8.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 2016 716CE Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 2016 716CE Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Designed to ensure the same, great tone and dynamic range of a Grand Symphony, but in a more compact and easily transportable body, the GS Mini-e bass is perfect for taking with you wherever you go. This left-handed model is designed for all the lefties so that they don't miss out on the fun.</p><h3>Outstanding Taylor construction</h3><p>The back and sides are constructed from layered sapele, which isn't just beautiful to look at, but boasts exceptional durability and contributes to the affordability of the bass. A core of poplar is sandwiched between two veneers of sapele, which gives the back and sides greater resilience when dealing with changes in humidity - often the case with life on the road and a must for this travel-friendly model.</p><p>The top wood is built using solid Sitka spruce, a bright sounding tonewood that projects efficiently to generate a wide dynamic range.

However, thanks to Taylor's collaboration with D'Addario to create custom nylon-core string with phosphor bronze wrap wire, the bass responds with a delightfully slinky feel. The condensed fret-spacing makes this model a joy for anybody to play, from children and new bass players, to adults and seasoned pros.</p><h3>Taylor's ES-B electronics</h3><p>In addition to the natural acoustic ability of the GS Mini-e bass, Taylor's ES-B pickup/preamp has been fitted for playback via an amplifier. The ES-B pickup incorporates Taylor's Expression 2 piezo design elements, which is paired with a built-in preamp with digital chromatic tuner. The preamp/tuner has a built-in LED display to indicate tuning, low-battery, and independent Volume and Tone controls. A pair of two button cell 3V batteries provide approximately 300 hours of use, and battery life is conserved thanks to an auto-off system that kicks in after 3 minutes of the guitar being idle.</p><p>Taylor GS Mini-e Bass Left-Handed Acoustic Bass Guitar in Natural is perfect for touring bassists who demand excellence. Whether you're playing plugged or unplugged, fingerstyle or picking, you can rest assured that this little beauty is ready and waiting, good to go whenever you are.

The Academy 12e-N is an electro acoustic nylon-string Grand Concert model, and Taylor consider this to be potentially the best nylon-string guitar you will get at this price.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>The Academy 12e-N has a smaller frame thanks to its Grand Concert body design, enhancing comfort alongside the nylon strings which feel a little easier on the fingertips. The body features a tapered waist, and an ergonomic armrest is built into the body to further improve the playing feel.</p><p>The soundboard is constructed from a natural hybrid of Sitka and White spruce known as Lutz Spruce. The spruce provides a dynamic response and a strong attack as well as spacious, clear projection. Beneath the soundboard the Academy 12e-N features internal bracing to add warmth to your sound, working with the mellow tone of the nylon strings for fingerpicking and strumming. Layered sapele makes up the back and sides of the Academy 12e-N which has a striking appearance but the feel of a powerhouse.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>The Academy 12e-N is firmly joined with a smooth, patented mahogany neck via a scarf neck joint. Topping the neck is an ebony fingerboard with decorative 4mm dot inlays to guide you throughout each fret transition with confidence.</p><h3>ES-B Electronics</h3><p>The Academy 12e-N is equipped with the ES-B pickup / preamp combo, a fusion of Taylor's Expression System 2 piezo design with a built-in digital chromatic tuner. The ES-B preamp has an LED display allowing you to easily see when you are retuning, and it conveniently shows the live battery status. Simple Tone and Volume controls allow you to tweak your tone to suit your playing needs. The preamp requires just two button cell 3v lithium batteries which will then give you around 300 hours of use; so from the practice session through to the live gig you can be sure that you won't have a power out. The ES-B preamp can automatically switch itself off when it is not in use for over three minutes to conserve battery power.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>The headstock of the Academy 12e-N is fitted with nylon nickel tuners with pearloid buttons to ensure that superb Academy Series sound is as accurate as possible. A Tusq nut and saddle works with the tuners and bridge to augment sustain of the nylon strings. Each Academy 12e-N comes supplied with a lightweight gig bag for protection when travelling with your guitar out on the road.

Modelled on the Grand Symphony, the GS Mini produces the same lush tonal palette and impressive power of its larger cousin, but is much easier to transport. Built to the high standard of quality we have come to expect from the team at Taylor, this is a fantastic model that is built to take all you can throw at it.</p><h3>Superb Taylor Construction</h3><p>The back and sides of the guitar are built using laminate rosewood, which has the enviable tonal qualities of delivering a sweet and warm mid-range, whilst gently stretching beyond into the lower and upper frequency ranges to ensure a full-bodied timbre. The beauty of employing laminate material in the GS Mini means that it is much more resilient than a solid tonewood when dealing with changes in humidity, making it an excellent guitar to take on your travels.</p><p>The top is constructed from a Taylor favourite, Sitka spruce. Noted for its excellent resonant qualities, it makes the perfect soundboard as it projects the timbre of the GS Mini with effortless grace and articulation. The top is reinforced using the GS Mini bracing pattern with relief rout, giving the spruce enough space to resonate freely, whilst maintaining a supportive and robust framework to prevent buckling or warping over time. Whatever style of music your play, and however you prefer to play - i.e. using a pick or fingerstyle -, you can rest assured that the subtle nuances of your performances will be translated with the utmost clarity.</p><h3>Taylor Expression System T Electronics</h3><p>In addition to the natural sound projection abilities of the tonewoods, the guitar comes with Taylor's ES-T electronics system for times when you wish to play through an amplifier.

It is much smaller in size and scale when compared to the popular dreadnought, but can easily hold its own with regard to unleashing a powerful tonal volley, whilst each note is delivered with absolute clarity. Whether you're a soloist or perform as part of an ensemble, a fingerstyle player or a strummer, the Grand Auditorium is suited to any musical and playing style. This is an excellent shape if you're a session musician, or simply someone who wants a guitar that covers all bases with the greatest of ease.</p><p>The top of the 114e is made from solid Sitka spruce, a tonewood that is favoured by Taylor due to its characteristically high level of resonance, making it the perfect soundboard. Taylor's forward shifted bracing pattern supports the top to prevent buckling or warping over time. The bright sounding Sitka delivers an incisive bite in the upper frequency range, which cuts through the darker sounding walnut used in the back and sides.</p><h3>High clarity pickup</h3><p>In addition to the natural sound projection abilities of the tonewoods and dreadnought body shape, the 114e is fitted with Taylor's Expression System 2 electronics system, which allows you to plug the guitar into an amplifier. The ES-2 is a single-source, under-saddle transducer with individual response elements for each string. It features a built-in preamp to give the signal a boost, if necessary, and the same active controls that are on the full ES in more expensive models. These are discreetly tucked away so that they don't interfere with your playing.</p><p>A smooth and sturdy sapele neck is fitted to the body of the 2017 114e. Set along a 25-1/2"""" scale length, the neck provides the perfect support to play on. Married to the neck is a sumptuous ebony fingerboard, which responds with the utmost accuracy to every nuance of your playing style. Taylors die-cast chrome tuners uphold tuning integrity throughout each and every performance. The smooth and smart black pickguard protects the body top from unwanted nicks and scrapes, whilst creating a subtle contrast to the gorgeous natural finish. Taylor has also supplied the 114e with a protective gig bag, allowing you to transport your new guitar around in style.</p><p>Taylor Guitars have an incredible reputation when it comes to premium guitar production and the 2017 114e Walnut Electro Acoustic Guitar is testimony to this - A real object of desire.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1034-1034-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/1697cf3e5ae6bc310b45fa12ef5bee2a.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 2017 114e Walnut Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 2017 114e Walnut Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The 412-e R LTD is shaped to the Grand Concert profile and is built using high quality materials that contribute to a powerful acoustic voice. The concert-style body is particularly appealing to fingerstyle guitarists, and the 412-e R LTD can cover a great scope of various genres with optimum playability.</p><h3>GRAND CONCERT BODY</h3><p>The Grand Concert body is the smallest full-size Taylor guitar, and its compact design proves to be incredibly comfortable. The 412-e R LTD Grand Concert can project with plenty of volume just like a dreadnought or jumbo but its articulate tone is second to none all thanks to its compact shape. The shape of the guitar makes it ideal for recording in the studio or using on stage as a session player, further enhanced by the onboard electronics. Its shorter scale length ensures fretting is made easier too.</p><p>Sitka spruce is used in the body top and is paired with Indian rosewood in the back and sides. The spruce is flexible which brings out a great range of tones whether you're into strumming big chords or fingerpicking. The body top features performance bracing with relief rout for added strength and resilience. Indian rosewood offers rich acoustic tones across all frequencies, from dark to bright.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>Tropical mahogany is used to construct the neck and its satin finish allows for a more comfortable playing feel. Topping the neck is a ebony fingerboard with 20 frets on offer, decorated with 4mm dot Italian acrylic inlays to guide you along. Taylor's choice of mahogany and ebony in the neck lets you experiment with various playing techniques, from fast fretting and fingerpicking to strumming chords with great resonance.</p><h3>ELECTRONICS</h3><p>Expression System 2 electronics are fitted to the Taylor 412-e R LTD for an improved, amplified acoustic output. This preamp is completely innovative as the piezo pickup is fitted beneath the saddle rather than underneath it. The piezo pickup has three individually calibrated sensors which work exceptionally well in seizing the natural acoustic timbre of the guitar and bringing it accurately through an amplifier.</p><p>With simple controls for Volume and Tone you can shape your tone without any hassle.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>Taylor nickel tuners are fitted to the headstock to maintain precise tuning throughout being played. The stunning natural finish of the body is complemented by a protective tortoise pickguard and a three-ring soundhole rosette.</p><p>The 412-e R LTD includes a Taylor Deluxe Hardshell case in Brown to keep the guitar in the best possible condition when not in use.

The 410e-R LTD has been carefully constructed using top quality tonewoods to contribute to a sweeping acoustic projection with clarity and volume. The dreadnought guitar has often been described as a """"workhorse"""" and the Taylor 410e-R is no exception.</p><h3>CLASSIC DREADNOUGHT</h3><p>As mentioned, Taylor have built the 410e-R to the classic dreadnought body profile. This particular body shape has been long-established in the world of guitars thanks to its versatile tonal range, accomplishing complex lows and bright, snappy highs.</p><p>Taylor have employed Sitka spruce in the body top, a tonewood which has been used in the construction of a vast majority of the Taylor acoustic guitars. It is a strong yet supple material, and with the inclusion of performance bracing with the patented relief rout it adds more elasticity and durability which consequently enhances the overall sound output. The back and sides are made from Indian rosewood which is a great all-rounder, with a consistent tone, producing bright high end and treble tones to deep low ends.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>A tropical mahogany neck is firmly joined to the body and has a comfortable satin finish. The neck is paired with an ebony fingerboard with 20 frets for you to explore helped by 4mm dot Italian acrylic inlays to guide you.

This Grand Auditorium takes the huge sound of a Dreadnought and packs it into dimensions that are a little larger than a Grand Concert. This creates an instrument with a clear, balanced tone, which responds well to picking and strumming but is small enough for finger-style play. You really can have it all.</p><p>Making up the top of the guitar is a classic acoustic guitar tonewood, solid Sitka spruce. Made popular with good reason, spruce is noted for its clarity, brightness, and expansive dynamic range, along with being a wood that ages particularly well, gaining subtle but distinctive characteristics the more it is played.</p><p>In the Taylor 214ce this is partnered with laminate rosewood back and sides, which are constructed with a poplar core between outer layers of rosewood.

This accessible model is built to the high standard of quality we've come to expect from the team at Taylor, with a range of features that are normally associated with their more expensive models.</p><h3>Luxurious Tonewoods</h3><p>The body is shaped to that of the powerful dreadnought body profile, which is noted for its balance of powerful projection and well-rounded timbre. The instantly recognisable shape is probably the most familiar amongst all guitarists, sitting comfortable in the hands and providing a robust performance partner that is suited to intimate gigs just as much as the stadium stage. The black pickguard protects the body top from unwanted nicks and scrapes, and creates a subtle contrast to the subtle natural finish.</p><p>The back and sides of the body have been built from layered sapele, which is composed of a central core of poplar that is pressed between interior and exterior layers of sapele veneers. The layered nature of the back and sides gives it incredible resilience when handling changes in humidity and temperature - making it superb for touring guitarists who want a guitar that travels well.</p><p>The body top is made from Sitka spruce, which is a highly flexible tonewood with enviable resonant properties that make it a fantastic soundboard. Reinforced using Taylor's forward shifted bracing pattern, the top delivers the timbre generated by the tonewoods and dreadnought shape with power and clarity.</p><h3>Supportive Sapele Neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a reassuringly solid sapele neck, which is paired with a delightful 20-fret ebony fingerboard that is adorned with 6mm dot position inlays. The neck is treated to a varnish that guarantees a smooth and responsive playing feel, whilst preserving the longevity of the wood.</p><h3>Road-Ready Hardware</h3><p>Taking care of the tuning are the die-cast tuning machines, which guarantee that your tuning will be held securely, no matter how enthusiastically you strike the strings. The Nubone nut and Tusq saddle work together with the Indian rosewood bridge, to optimise action and intonation whilst creating a seamless link between the strings and body. The Taylor 110e dreadnought electro acoustic guitar comes with a gig bag, so you're good to get out and gig as soon as it arrives.</p><h3>Taylor's Expression System T Electronics</h3><p>In addition to the natural sound projection abilities of the tonewoods and dreadnought body shape, the 110e is fitted with Taylor's ES-T electronics system, which allows you to plug the guitar into an amplifier. The ES-T is a single-source, under-saddle transducer with individual response elements for each string. It features a built-in preamp to give the signal a boost, if necessary, and the same active controls that are on the full ES in more expensive models. These are discreetly tucked away so that they don't interfere with your playing.</p><p>The Taylor 110e left-handed dreadnought electro acoustic guitar in natural comes equipped with Elixir Phosphor Bronze Medium strings, as well as a gig bag to get you up and running for your first gig with immediate effect.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1015-1015-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/4a6304f0cf9b4b7f80e70c49fb15c33a.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 110e Left-Handed Dreadnought Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 110e Left-Handed Dreadnought Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Add a hardshell case and accessory kit and you've got yourself quite the package!</p><h3>Sublime solidbody SG</h3><p>The Gibson USA 2018 SG Standard is built and shaped to the classic slimline double-cutaway """"horns"""" profile we've all come to know and love. The unfussy yet undeniably cool design has often been imitated but never equalled. With gently bevelled edges and a balanced weight distribution, the 2018 SG is comfortable in the hands and a joy to wield. The body is crafted from mahogany, a tonewood that is favoured by Gibson due to its ability to generate masses of power infused with warmth. The finish is protected by a coating of gloss nitrocellulose lacquer that protects against unwanted blemishes detracting from the visual aesthetic.</p><h3>Fast playing neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a deftly crafted mahogany neck, which is shaped to the slimtaper profile for a lightning fast feel. Married to the neck is a luxurious rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 medium frets that have been cryogenically treated. The fingerboard is decorated with acrylic trapezoid position inlays, whilst white binding guarantees seamless transitions between every fret.</p><h3>'61 humbuckers</h3><p>To recreate classic '61 tone, the 2018 SG Standard is equipped with Gibson's 61R in the neck, and 61T in the bridge. Designed to produce a high-gain output, these humbuckers not only offer a sweet rendition of those early pickups, but also slide perfectly into modern day rock styles too. Control over the pickups comes in the form of a pair of volume pots, a pair of tone pots, and a three-way toggle switch to select either pickup independently or both simultaneously. In keeping with the vintage vibe, black 'Top Hat' knobs have been employed as the control pots.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The headstock is home to a bell-shaped chrome truss rod cover, whilst the distinctive Gibson logo resides between the locking kidney tuning machines. The tuners and Tektoid nut work dutifully to uphold tuning integrity and string tension. The body is home to the chrome finished aluminium Tune-O-Matic bridge, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar tailpiece, a combination that anchors each string securely to optimise intonation and sustain throughout the most emphatic of performances.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,602-602-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/fc044d6e286a499fd21aa7b1f13d3de2.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson USA 2018 SG Standard Electric Guitar - Heritage Cherry","Gibson USA 2018 SG Standard Electric Guitar - Heritage Cherry",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

This astonishing guitar was the brainchild of car designer Ray Dietrich who worked alongside Ted McCarty (the then Gibson President). With its unique shape derived from car tailfins, this new Gibson was a revolution, and the 2018 rendition keeps many of the original historic features with some new improvements.</p><h3>Slim and lightweight body</h3><p>Unlike guitars at the time of its birth in the early 1960s, the Firebird had a reverse-style body and a longer right horn, which it retains today. The neck-through-body is constructed from mahogany, a preferred tonewood for Gibson. The mahogany body feels lightweight and comfortable, reducing fatigue especially for performers and live musicians.</p><h3>All mahogany neck</h3><p>As mentioned, the 2018 Firebird has a neck-through-body construction, which boosts sustain and grants full access to all the frets, even the upper registers. The neck is made up of mahogany and shaped to the classic Firebird Slim Taper profile for a faster, more comfortable feeling for the modern guitarist.</p><p>The neck is topped with a thick granadillo fingerboard providing you with 22 frets that have been cryogenically treated to enjoy maximum durability. The use of the thicker granadillo boosts tonal depth produced by the guitar for a high quality sound output. Gibson have fitted a Tektoid nut that is self-lubricating for a better return to pitch and improved sustain.</p><h3>Classic P90 pickups</h3><p>The 2018 Firebird Studio is equipped with a pair of P90 single cloil pickups, with one in the neck position and another in the bridge position. This gives you authentic vintage Gibson tone that made the Firebird so popular upon its creation.</p><p>Featuring the usual controls for rhythm and lead Volume and Tone and a 3-way toggle pickup switch, you can shape your tone to suit your playing needs. Each control has a black tophat with a silver insert, complementing the vintage sunburst finish.</p><h3>Exceptional hardware</h3><p>The Firebird headstock is directly fitted with the exceptional mini grover tuning keys. Their excellent design and precise ratio ensure consistency in tuning each string as well as improving the overall sustain. To further boost sustain and resonance there is a traditional chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge and an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece.</p><p>To protect and complement the body's smooth finish is a 3-ply black Firebird pickguard with the quintessential gold Firebird emblem. The 2018 Firebisrd studio also comes complete with a hardcase and Gibson accessory pack for protection and care.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,557-557-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/37fbd97306816b2f6038d848004650cf.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson USA 2018 Firebird Studio Electric Guitar - Vintage Sunburst","Gibson USA 2018 Firebird Studio Electric Guitar - Vintage Sunburst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The powerful dreadnought body is comprised of solid walnut on the back and sides, and a solid sitka spruce top. The walnut generates plenty of mid to low-end power, crucially giving the J-15 plenty of clout. The Gibson standard X-braced sitka spruce top, resonates wonderfully, which allows the sound to be projected loudly and clearly.</p><p>A thin but incredibly resilient coating of hand-sprayed nitrocellulose protects the body. This allows the tonewoods to remain in pristine condition for as long as possible, allowing you to appreciate that gorgeous natural finish for years to come.</p><h3> Neck </h3><p>A bright sounding maple neck carries the luxurious walnut fingerboard. The maple/walnut combination counters the deeply resonant body perfectly, by allowing the upper frequency ranges to ring out clearly and with excellent articulation. The neck is also finished with a thin layer of nitrocellulose, again to protect the wood from superficial playing wear and tear. It also has the excellent property of preventing the neck from becoming tacky, which means you can smoothly run your fretting hand up and down with the greatest of ease.</p><h3> Electronics </h3><p>The L.R. Baggs Element pickup system has been fitted to the J-15. Designed to mirror the soundboard's actual movement as you play, the incredibly responsive electronics system allows you to increase the level of the J-15 without colouring the signal with unwanted noise, compression or phasing.</p><h3> Hardware </h3><p>A teardrop tortoise pickguard protects the lower bout of the body top from unwanted pick scrapes and playing damage. A sumptuous multi-ply binding to the top ensures the edges are reinforced and also protected from superficial chips to the tonewoods.</p><p>Mini Grover tuning machines keep you strings locked in the tuning you desire throughout each and every performance, whilst the traditional rectangle-shaped walnut bridge reinforces the strings' connection to the body.</p><p>The power and tonal versatility of the Gibson J-15 electro acoustic - even before you plug in and amp it up - is simply breathtaking.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,520-520-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/5327409ed549081787a31ec36d5bcd7b.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson J-15 Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Gibson J-15 Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The SG Standard HP is equipped with a fast access heel for exceptional, easy reach to every fret, further boosted by the double cutaway.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>A smooth, Soloist mahogany neck is fitted to the SG Standard HP, providing extra room to play with. The neck has a Slim Taper profile, a popular choice for those who have a preference towards a much faster playing style.</p><p>The neck is topped with a sumptuous, dark rosewood fingerboard with a 12 inch radius and 22 easy-to-reach frets. Classic Mother of Pearl trapezoid inlays decorate the frets, guiding you from one to the next with complete confidence. For unrestricted control over string action and better sustain there is a titanium zero-fret adjustable nut with locking feature.</p><h3>ELECTRONICS</h3><p>Gibson have employed a pair of classic humbucker pickups in the 2017 SG Standard HP, with a '57 Classic in the neck position and a '57 Classic + in the bridge position. The '57 Classic humbuckers are designed to accurately replicate the original PAF-style tone heard on the original SG models many years ago.</p><p>The controls follow suit on previous models, with four knobs for rhythm and lead Volume and Tone, plus a 3-way pickup toggle switch to shape your SG sound. With upgraded wiring for the 2017 model, the controls work brilliantly to offer the desired tone you're looking for. The chrome-plated knobs and switch tip are designed to improve grip, so even on a dark, hot stage you'll have no problem making adjustments.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>There is updated, modern chrome hardware featured on the SG Standard HP, from the bell-shaped truss rod cover, tuning keys, Gibson logo and crown on the headstock to the bridge, tailpiece and control knobs. The headstock is now fitted with an improved version of the G FORCE automatic tuning system. Retuning your strings is a doddle with this accurate system, plus it has been calibrated to prevent any unwanted noise or interference.</p><p>A traditional chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge is fitted to the lower bout of the body with titanium saddles joined by an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece with locking studs for top quality sustain and resonance.</p><p>The small teardrop pickguard is designed to both protect and complement the stunning finish of the SG Standard HP, while the white fingerboard binding on the neck also helps complete the look. Gibson include a premium Gibson aluminium hard case, strap and polishing cloth with the purchase of a 2017 SG Standard HP, enabling the new owner to keep it in the finest condition for years to come.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,489-489-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/99eab07ebb27675f6306e0bdd58fe7cd.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 SG Standard HP Electric Guitar - Ebony","Gibson 2017 SG Standard HP Electric Guitar - Ebony",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Adopting the traditional 12-fret design in favour of a joint at the 14th fret, the guitar is afforded a more robust response. As well as this, additional deluxe upgrades have been included in the build to make this the ideal guitar for professionals and those who demand the best!</p><h3>Grand Concert body</h3><p>The Grand Concert body profile is slightly smaller than a more recognisable dreadnought, which makes it great for fingerstyle players. The tapered waist and ergonomically designed radius armrest come together to maximise playing comfort, whether you play in a seated or a standing position. As noted above, the 12-fret design creates a more robust output, as the bridge is moved further down the lower bout of the guitar to compensate for the adjusted neck joint. The combination is a nuanced timbre that has a much meatier character.</p><p>The body back and sides are constructed using Indian rosewood, which creates a warm tonal foundation with a generous low-end energy. The top is built using Sitka spruce - a Taylor favourite -, which provides the perfect soundboard for this exceptional model. Reinforced using Adirondack spruce advanced performance bracing with relief rout, the 812ce 12-fret is given an increased dynamic ceiling. Therefore, its size may be small, but its output is remarkably loud. Whether you fly solo or perform as part of a band or ensemble, the 812ce 12-fret nestles beautifully into any setup, whilst having the power and ability to hold its own. The understated natural finish is protected by a layer of gloss to protect and preserve the wood for as long as possible, allowing it to age gracefully.</p><h3>Durable neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body via a scarf joint is a supple yet supportive tropical mahogany neck. The neck has been treated to a satin finish to prevent unwanted stickiness or tackiness from impeding your movement. Paired with the neck is a luxurious ebony fingerboard, which is adorned with Taylor's Element inlays to guide your way in style. Ebony binding ensures smooth transitions between each and every fret. The elegantly shaped Venetian cutaway makes it even easier to reach the upper frets.</p><h3>Expression System 2 Electronics</h3><p>Taylor's exclusive Expression System 2 pickup is fitted in the 812ce to give you unparalleled amplification. The ES2 pickup features three uniquely positioned and individually calibrated pickup sensors that faithfully transmit the natural tones of the 812ce through recording equipment or an amplifier. Taylor have patented this behind-the-saddle design and it is one which captures all the tone on offer from the 812ce.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>Pale non-figured maple binding trims the top, whilst an abalone rosette encircles the soundhole. The ebony bridge features ebony dot bridge pins that complement the rosewood pickguard. The headstock is equipped with Taylor slot head tuning machines, which dutifully uphold tuning integrity with precision.</p><p>Taylor have ensured that you can keep your 812ce 12-Fret DLX electro acoustic guitar remains well-protected and safely stored by including a deluxe hardshell case.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1098-1098-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/2056b640809524204e70621863fd44c6.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 812ce 12-Fret DLX Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 812ce 12-Fret DLX Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The Expression System, now standard on all CE models, makes the 300 Series a great introduction to premium-quality, American-made, solid wood guitars. </p><p>A Grand Auditorium body, Venetian cutaway, and the Taylor Expression System add up to a versatile guitar that's perfect for stage and home. The Grand Auditorium combines the width and depth of a Dreadnought with a narrower waist. Its sleek design yields a strong treble zing across the tonal spectrum and sharpens the definition of individual notes. The Grand Auditorium is a strong fingerpicking guitar that also adapts well to medium strumming.</p><p>The warm tone and open midrange of sapele balances the bright and snappy characteristics of a Sitka spruce top. The resulting combination provides the perfect guitar for strong, rhythmic playing styles.</p><p>Designed to faithfully reproduce your guitar's native tone, the Expression System utilizes patented Dynamic Sensors to capture top and string vibration like never before. Created in partnership with renowned audio pioneer, Mr. Rupert Neve, the Taylor ES is seamlessly integrated into the design of the guitar from the ground up. Onboard tone controls provide added flavour, or set flat for an uncolored, exceptionally clean amplified sound.</p><p>The finish used to create this guitar's textured satin back and sides and lustrous gloss top was developed at Taylor for maximum durability and resistance to cold-checking. This ultra violet-cured finish is also more environmentally friendly than traditional lacquer finishes.

The onboard tuner allows you to keep your tuning in check and a useful battery life indicator ensures you don't have to worry about how much power is left.</p><h3> Hardware </h3><p>The gold-plated hardware offsets the sunburst body finish and the natural rosewood fingerboard perfectly.

The inclusion of a stylish Venetian cutaway enables greater access to the upper frets, making this one model a joy to perform with.</p><p></p><h3> Classic Taylor Construction </h3><p>The Taylor 322ce is built using the small bodied Grand Concert profile, which was designed to meet the needs of delicate fingerstyle players who wanted guitar that was easier to perform with, without compromising on tone or power. The compact form of the body and tapered waist limits the opportunity for overtones to overwhelm the timbre of the 322ce.</p><h3> Superb Tonewoods </h3><p>The top is built using solid tropical mahogany, a dense tonewood that delivers a subtle blast of warm energy. Over time, the tropical mahogany will develop as the guitar is performed with, ensuring each and every model will mature in its own unique way. The top is reinforced with forward-shifted bracing that features Taylor's patented relief rout. The relief rout allows the mahogany to resonate with greater flexibility, without sacrificing structural integrity.</p><p>The back and side wood of the 322ce is built using sapele, a tonewood that is noted for having similar harmonic qualities to mahogany, delivering soothing lows and warm mid tones. The combination of the mahogany top and sapele back and sides, creates a guitar with a high degree of low-end depth that is matched with a bright and snappy upper midrange. The body is bound in black to create a seamless connection between the tonewoods, whilst a black pickguard protect the top of the body beneath the strings.</p><h3>Exquisite Neck and Fingerboard Partnership</h3><p>The neck is constructed from reassuringly unyielding tropical mahogany. The wider neck that allows intricate fingerings to be played over a very comfortable surface area. The shortened scale length of the neck - 24-7/8"""" - reduces string tension, which means less effort goes into fretting notes and makes the guitar much easier to play. Coupled with a 20-fret ebony fingerboard, this combination is a joy to perform on, responding delightfully to the subtle nuances of your playing style with effortless grace.</p><h3> Robust Hardware </h3><p>Fitted to the headstock are the ever resilient Taylor nickel tuning machines, which hold strings firmly to guarantee tuning stability and integrity throughout each and every performance. The top of the neck is home to the Tusq nut, whilst the body bears a Tusq saddle, both responsible for maintaining string tension and intonation, which they do with ease. Ebony bridge pins are a stylish and reassuringly solid touch.</p><h3>Expression System 2</h3><p>Featuring three uniquely positioned and individually calibrated pickup sensors, the Expression System 2 is designed to capture a more dynamic range of acoustic sound than ever before. Together with Taylor's custom-designed preamp, the Expression System 2 produces faithful and powerful amplified tone with superb response. Whether you plan to go through a PA system or directly into recording software, you can be sure that you will hear the natural beauty of the Taylor 322ce represented whole-heartedly.</p><h3>Finish</h3><p>The Taylor 322e top, back, sides and neck are all protected with a satin finish. This is durable enough to withstand minor scratches and scrapes whilst remaining thin enough to allow the wood to resonate without being impeded. The headstock overlay is fashioned from Indian rosewood.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1050-1050-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/651e9fa39e117d68c1a7ceb3b8ce503b.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 322ce Grand Concert Electro Acoustic - Natural","Taylor 322ce Grand Concert Electro Acoustic - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The sturdy workmanship comes as no surprise, the team at Gretsch know a thing or two about crafting road-ready models that keep up with the most demanding of performers. The stylish vintage finishes are matched by perfectly appointed modern touches that combine to create a heavenly instrument. If you're a left-handed rock 'n' roller, then it doesn't get much better than the G5420LH.</p><h3> Bound single-cutaway body </h3><p>Gretsch have shaped the G5420LH to a thinline hollow body design, which is built to create the perfect marriage of comfortability and tonal versatility. By using 5-ply maple as the body tonewood, the guitar is afforded a confident midrange character that has a gently rounded bottom-end, and sings across the highs with a sparkling clarity.</p><p>The body top is decorated with stylish over-sized bound f-holes that allows the acoustic timbre to project forth gracefully. The body is bound to create a stylish transition between the top and side woods. The paintwork has been treated to a slender yet resilient coating of gloss to preserving it for as long as possible. The body is completed by the application of a silver plexi pickguard, which proudly displays a black Gretsch logo.</p><h3> Gloss-finished maple neck </h3><p>Paired with the body is a gloss-finished maple neck, which is carved to a """"U""""-shape profile to guarantee a supportive and reassuring playing feel in the hand. Married to the neck is a bound rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 medium jumbo-sized frets that bear offset pearloid neo-classic thumbnail position inlays. The neck and fingerboard partnership establishes a confident playing feel, encouraging your fingers to roam freely. The 12-inch fingerboard radius allows your fretting hand to roll around in comfort, whilst string bends can be executed smoothly. The single cutaway body profile makes it significantly easier to reach the upper frets comfortably.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck is a Graph Tech nubone nut, which works in partnership with the vintage-style open-back tuning machines to uphold string tension and tuning integrity. Fitted to the G5420LH is an adjusto-matic bridge with a secured rosewood-based, which is paired with a glorious Bigsby Licensed B60 vibrato tailpiece. The hardware creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain, whilst the Bigsby offers meticulous control over vibrato.</p><h3> Blacktop Filter'Tron pickups </h3><p>Fitted to the body are two BlackTop Filter'Tron humbuckers in the neck and bridge positions. Designed to enhance the """"fat"""" timbre produced by the body, this pair produce an enviable tonal arsenal for you to play with. The neck position enhances the plucky articulation of the neck and fingerboard, whilst the bridge pickup draws more from the body, generating a thunderous charge when you want it.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of a three-way pickup selector toggle switch, which allows you to select either pickup independently or select both outputs simultaneously for a fuller tone. Each pickup has an independent volume knob, and both are connected to master volume and tone pots.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gretsch Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,630-630-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/8bba318dc3bb103d223133bc126b2203.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"G5420LH Electromatic Hollowbody Guitar - Orange Stain","G5420LH Electromatic Hollowbody Guitar - Orange Stain",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The D-17M features the much loved and desired dreadnought body which is more than capable of producing blistering rock tones and yielding gentle finger-picked whispers. </p><p>The top is built from Solid Sikta Spruce, a North American tonewood that is a popular choice in the construction of high-end acoustic guitars. Sikta Spruce has the enviable combination of being more lightweight than mahogany whilst having exceptional resilience, strength and elasticity. This gives the guitar a range of diverse tonal qualities from deep Lows, through warm Mids to crisp Highs without becoming laborious to hold. The top is reinforced using an A-Frame bracing technique, giving further strength to the body to prevent the chance of buckling over time as well as giving a very secure feel to the body.</p><p>The back and sides of the guitar are built from Solid Genuine Mahogany, a naturally dense and warm sounding wood that reinforces the mid to low range frequency output of the guitar to give a denser character to the guitar's sound output. The bellied design of the bridge, coupled with the mahogany back and sides, encourages the guitar to project a naturally fuller sound. Due to the dreadnought body you don't have to dig in to get a lot of volume out of this guitar as it packs a punch all by itself.</p><p>The neck is cut to the Modified Low Oval profile, which creates a comfortable playing position. The neck has a generous 25.4"""" scale length, which is home to 20 very playable frets. The fingerboard width at the nut is 1-11/16"""" extending to 2-1/8"""" at the 12th fret. Although some fingerstyle players may prefer a 1-1/3"""" width at the nut, the guitar is still very accommodating giving a very agreeable playing surface.</p><p>The fingerboard has been from crafted solid East Indian rosewood and contains 14 clear frets with a total number of 20 frets, and is matched with a headplate of the same material.</p><p>The body is sealed with Tortoise colour binding.

The D-15M takes a lot of influence from models which precede this, from as far back as the 40s. The distinctive dreadnought body profile has been revered by many guitarists over the years. A superior blend of tonewood has been employed to allow the D-15M to resonate freely and generate a full-bodied, vintage acoustic voice.</p><h3>DREADNOUGHT BODY</h3><p>As per many previous, classic Martins, the D-15M is shaped to the dreadnought profile and hails from the 15 Series. The dreadnought shape is one of the leading types of guitar body profiles and it has the ability to produce a mighty sustain with a deep tonal range. The body shape enhances the sound that the guitar is capable of producing but also looks the part whether you're playing for pleasure or in the studio.</p><h3>BEAUTIFUL BLEND OF TONEWOODS</h3><p>The conventional dreadnought D-15M guitar is given a solid sitka spruce top because of its flexibility and capacity to project a dynamic, articulate range of tones which works whether you prefer fingerstyle playing or strumming big chords. In order to bolster the stability of the soundboard, Martin have used A-Frame ''X-1'' bracing beneath the top which is a tried and tested technique that helps to improve the tonal range of the guitar while ensuring a strong playing feel.</p><p>The back and sides are built out of solid mahogany, known for its rich, dark tone and ability to resonate. Solid mahogany has a strong sound full of volume but its darker tone makes it a handy accomplice if you're singing along as it leaves room for your voice. Joined to the body is a solid mahogany neck with a modified low oval profile for comfortable playability. The neck is long with a scale length of 25.4 inches and has a 20-fret East Indian rosewood fingerboard atop of it. Of the 20 frets, 14 are open (unlike other acoustic guitars), so you can experiment freely with those higher notes without getting uncomfortable. To help you along the frets are sophisticated diamond and square position inlays.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>To uphold tuning integrity with accuracy and precision, Martin have fitted nickel open geared tuning machines with butterbean knobs to the headstock. The belly style bridge is constructed from solid East Indian rosewood and it has a firm connection between the body and the strings so that you can play on for hours with confidence.</p><p>A single ring rosette decorates the soundhole and is accompanied by a tortoise pickguard which offers added protection against scratches. The rosette and pickguard also give the D-15M guitar a very slick finish to its appearance.</p><p>The Martin D-15M Acoustic Guitar is packed with premium features to give you an enticing instrument that has a vintage, full-bodied acoustic sound that stands out from the rest. To further protect your brand new guitar whether on the road or in safe storage, Martin have supplied a guitar case to go with the D-15M.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Martin Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,943-943-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/f033497b044cf5a978f9c612a9abee11.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Martin D-15M Acoustic Guitar with Case - Natural","Martin D-15M Acoustic Guitar with Case - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Resurrecting a level of design, detail, and craftsmanship from a bygone era, from a time when travellers would wander across the USA with little more than the clothes on their back, and a guitar in their hands, the G9511 is perfect for blues, bluegrass, country, and folk fans who want to recapture the authenticity of that time.</p><h3> Beautiful parlor body </h3><p>As we've come to expect from Gretsch, the G9511 single-0 is lovingly crafted using high quality tonewoods to produce a rich timbre. Shaped to the diminutive parlor body shape, the guitar may be small, but it boasts a sophisticated character with an impressive dynamic range.</p><p>The body back and sides are built using laminated mahogany, which establishes a confident mid-range tonal foundation. The use of laminate wood also gives the body greater resilience in handling changes in humidity and temperature, making it great for travelling with. The top is built from solid spruce, a fantastic choice for use as the soundboard due to its willingness to resonate enthusiastically. Reinforced using quartersawn X-bracing, the top can move freely to produce a powerful output, without capitulating to unwanted buckling or warping.</p><h3> Sturdy mahogany neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a 24.875-inch scale length mahogany neck, which provides a generous playing support that is as solid as they come. Treated to a satin finish, your fret hand is given the freedom to roam without stickiness or tackiness from impeding your movement. Shaped to the slim """"C"""" profile, the neck sits comfortably in the hand. Paired with the neck is a 19-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with mother-of-pearl diamond inlays to guide you.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>Starting at the headstock, you'll find vintage-style open-back tuning machines, which work dutifully alongside the bone nut to ensure uniform string tension and tuning integrity. The body is home to a rosewood bridge, which anchors each string securely to optimise intonation and sustain. Aged white neck binding traces from the headstock to the body, complementing the exquisite Appalachia Cloudburst finish perfectly.</p><p>The Gretsch Style 1 G9511 Single-0 Parlor Acoustic Guitar in Appalachia Cloudburst is perfect across a wide range of musical styles, and is suited to both fingerstyle and flatpicking. Whether you're performing solo or as part of an ensemble, the vibrant timbre of this beauty is astounding for its size.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gretsch Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,653-653-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/9d89edbda2cd0bfe5fc7f8a2ce3229c5.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"G9511 Single-0 Parlor Acoustic Guitar - Appalachia Burst","G9511 Single-0 Parlor Acoustic Guitar - Appalachia Burst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The compact size of the Grand Concert, with its dramatically tapered waist keeping overtones in check, and its wider neck that is a godsend for complex fingerings as is the shorter, 24 7/8-inch, scale length, make the Taylor 312ce Electro Acoustic Guitar extremely comfortable play.</p><p>In place for the top of the guitar is solid Sitka spruce, providing its trademark bright tone with clarity and articulation across a broad dynamic range.

This it does with a combination of the Dynamic Body Sensor (mounted to the soundboard) and the Dynamic String Sensor (embedded beneath the fretboard), to capture a realistic image of the guitar.

Benefiting from beautifully crafted tonewoods that are shaped to the joyfully playable grand auditorium body with venetian cutaway, and fitted with superb Taylor Expression System T electronics, the 114ce is a fantastic model for players of all ages.</p><h3>Luxurious Tonewoods</h3><p>The body is shaped to that of the Grand Auditorium body profile, combining the width and depth of a dreadnought to generate impeccable energy, with a narrower waist that allows treble notes to sizzle with a clear and focused energy. If you're a fingerpicker who craves clarity across the neck, then this is the model for you. The Venetian cutaway also affords greater upper fret access to give you absolute freedom as your tap, sweep, and pick your way through every performance.</p><p>The body top is made from Sitka spruce, which is a highly flexible tonewood with enviable resonant properties that make it a fantastic soundboard. Reinforced using Taylor's forward shifted bracing pattern, the top delivers the timbre generated by the tonewoods and dreadnought shape with power and clarity.</p><p>The back and sides of the body have been built from layered sapele, which is composed of a central core of poplar that is pressed between interior and exterior layers of sapele veneers. The layered nature of the back and sides gives it incredible resilience when handling changes in humidity and temperature - making it superb for touring guitarists who want a guitar that travels well.</p><h3>Supportive Sapele Neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a reassuringly solid sapele neck, which is paired with a delightful 20-fret ebony fingerboard that is adorned with 6mm dot position inlays. The neck is treated to a varnish that guarantees a smooth and responsive playing feel, whilst preserving the longevity of the wood.</p><h3>Taylor's Expression System T Electronics</h3><p>In addition to the natural sound projection abilities of the tonewoods and dreadnought body shape, the 114ce is fitted with Taylor's ES-T electronics system, which allows you to plug the guitar into an amplifier. The ES-T is a single-source, under-saddle transducer with individual response elements for each string. It features a built-in preamp to give the signal a boost, if necessary, and the same active controls that are on the full ES in more expensive models. These are discreetly tucked away so that they don't interfere with your playing.</p><h3>Road-Ready Hardware</h3><p>Taking care of the tuning are the die-cast tuning machines, which guarantee that your tuning will be held securely, no matter how enthusiastically you strike the strings. The Nubone nut and Tusq saddle work together with the Indian rosewood bridge, to optimise action and intonation whilst creating a seamless link between the strings and body.

The D-18E hails from Martin's Retro series, delivering an outstanding electro acoustic guitar that takes us back in time to a more vintage feel and sound that is well-built for the modern musician.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>The D-18E Retro has a solid build with a non-cutaway dreadnought design. Despite its somewhat straightforward appearance, this adds to its vintage character. The top is constructed from solid Sitka spruce which is perfectly partnered by solid genuine mahogany in the back and sides for a clear and responsive range of tones, all with added warmth. The body top also features standard """"X"""" bracing with forward shifted pattern to strengthen the Sitka spruce soundboard and improve its overall sound quality. The D-18E Retro produces a dynamic sound which suits the more traditional acoustic guitarist.</p><h3>High Performance Neck</h3><p>Joined firmly to the body is a modified low oval hardwood neck with a Performing Artist taper profile for an all-round comfortable playing feel in the hand. The neck is topped with a 20-fret ebony fingerboard which is adorned with Old Style 18 green abalone inlays to guide you.</p><h3>Fishman Electronics</h3><p>Amplifying the natural sound of the D-18E Retro is the Fishman F1 Aura+ preamp. The primary design feature of this preamp is to ensure that it is simple to use, and that has been achieved along with award-winning Aura Acoustic Imaging technology. The F1 Aura+ is intuitive and is designed to make tone-shaping even easier throughout any performance. The preamp has two control buttons alongside a bright LED display to make sound tweaks whenever you need to.</p><p>Thanks to the preamp having an """"Easy Mode"""", you can scroll through 3 custom-blended Aura Image presets. With just the one Tone control knob, you can explore a natural under-saddle pickup sound to a more """"scooped"""" tone with enhanced treble and bass. The F1 Aura+ also features """"Performance Mode"""", whereby you can access the 3-Band EQs, compressor, automatic anti-feedback filter and digital chromatic tuner.</p><h3>Hardware and Finish</h3><p>For a strong connection between the strings and body, Martin have fitted the lower bout of the body with a 1930s style belly ebony bridge with a drop-in saddle. The headstock is fitted with nickel open-geared tuning machines with butterbean knobs, so you can retune with accuracy alongside the built-in digital chromatic tuner. The natural finish of the body is further protected by a decorative Delmar tortoise pickguard.</p><p>Martin have done plenty of research on many of their own pre-war guitars from the museum to help construct the Retro Series models, and so with the onboard F1 Aura+ preamp you can be sure to have plenty of volume without compromising on its vintage-style tone.</p><p>Each D-18E Retro guitar comes with a hardshell case for added protection and easy portability.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Martin Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,952-952-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/b95ac9cded5b1a15f44ab963023353e8.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Martin D-18E Retro Electro Acoustic Guitar","Martin D-18E Retro Electro Acoustic Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Add to that their Expression System 2 electronics, gig-ready hardware, and a flawless finish, and you have an exceptional model that is a dream to perform with.</p><h3>Grand Concert body</h3><p>Taylor's Grand Concert design is a smaller-bodied guitar that is perfect for fingerstyle players. The tapered waist makes it exceptional comfortable to perform with in both the studio and on the stage. The Grand Concert doesn't produce the booming energy of a dreadnought, which makes it perfect for nuanced performances that require tonal subtlety.</p><p>The traditional 12-fret design adheres to early 20th Century models that are highly regarded by purists. As the neck joint is at the 12th fret rather than the 14th, the bridge is shifted towards the centre of the lower bout. The effect this has on the tone is measurable, producing a richer, aurally-pleasing timbre. It also enhances the playability of the neck, as the upper frets are within easier reach.</p><p>The body back and sides are constructed using Indian rosewood, which creates a warm tonal foundation with a hearty midrange energy. The top is built from Lutz spruce, which is reinforced with performance bracing with relief rout. The bracing enables the soundboard to resonate freely to produce an enviable projection. You can rest assured that the subtle nuances of your performance will sing out beautifully.</p><h3>Durable neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body via a scarf joint is a supple yet supportive tropical mahogany neck. The slightly wider Grand Concert neck profile and shorter scale length combine to accommodate complex fingerings. This also results in a slinkier feel due to the reduced tension. The neck has been treated to a satin finish to prevent unwanted stickiness or tackiness from impeding your movement. Paired with the neck is a luxurious ebony fingerboard, which is adorned with abalone reflection inlays to guide your way in style. Ebony binding ensures smooth transitions between each and every fret. The elegantly shaped Venetian cutaway makes it even easier to reach the upper frets.</p><h3>Expression System 2 Electronics</h3><p>Taylor's exclusive Expression System 2 pickup is fitted in the 712ce to give you unparalleled amplification. The ES2 pickup features three uniquely positioned and individually calibrated pickup sensors that faithfully transmit the natural tones of the 712ce through recording equipment or an amplifier. Taylor have patented this behind-the-saddle design and it is one which captures all the tone on offer from the 712ce.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>The gloss body finish protects the western sunburst finish. Non-figured Koa binding trims the top, whilst a 2016 3-Ring rosette encircles the soundhole. The ebony bridge features ebony dot bridge pins that complement the striped tortoise pickguard. The headstock is fitted with Taylor nickel tuners, which uphold tuning integrity dutifully throughout each and every performance.</p><p>Taylor have ensured that you can keep your 712ce 12 Fret Electro Acoustic Guitar remains well-protected and safely stored by including a deluxe hardshell case.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1083-1083-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/d71559574f2f90d0aa02a22be6e0dbdb.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 712ce 12 Fret Electro Acoustic Guitar - Western Sunburst","Taylor 712ce 12 Fret Electro Acoustic Guitar - Western Sunburst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

It is much smaller in size and scale when compared to the popular dreadnought, but can easily hold its own with regard to unleashing a powerful tonal volley, whilst each note is delivered with absolute clarity. Whether you're a soloist or perform as part of an ensemble, a fingerstyle player or a strummer, the Grand Auditorium is suited to any musical and playing style. This is an excellent shape if you're a session musician, or simply someone who wants a guitar that covers all bases with the greatest of ease.</p><p>The top of the 114e is made from solid Sitka spruce, a tonewood that is favoured by Taylor due to its characteristically high level of resonance, making it the perfect soundboard. Taylor's forward shifted bracing pattern supports the top to prevent buckling or warping over time. The bright sounding Sitka delivers an incisive bite in the upper frequency range, which cuts through the darker sounding walnut used in the back and sides.</p><h3>High clarity pickup</h3><p>In addition to the natural sound projection abilities of the tonewoods and dreadnought body shape, the 114e is fitted with Taylor's Expression System 2 electronics system, which allows you to plug the guitar into an amplifier. The ES-2 is a single-source, under-saddle transducer with individual response elements for each string. It features a built-in preamp to give the signal a boost, if necessary, and the same active controls that are on the full ES in more expensive models. These are discreetly tucked away so that they don't interfere with your playing.</p><p>A smooth and sturdy sapele neck is fitted to the body of the 2017 114e. Set along a 25-1/2"""" scale length, the neck provides the perfect support to play on. Married to the neck is a sumptuous ebony fingerboard, which responds with the utmost accuracy to every nuance of your playing style. Taylors die-cast chrome tuners uphold tuning integrity throughout each and every performance. The smooth and smart black pickguard protects the body top from unwanted nicks and scrapes, whilst creating a subtle contrast to the gorgeous natural finish. Taylor has also supplied the 114e with a protective gig bag, allowing you to transport your new guitar around in style.</p><p>Taylor Guitars have an incredible reputation when it comes to premium guitar production and the 2017 114e Walnut Electro Acoustic Guitar is testimony to this - A real object of desire.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1037-1037-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/1697cf3e5ae6bc310b45fa12ef5bee2a.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 2017 114e Walnut Left Handed Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 2017 114e Walnut Left Handed Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The guitar's unique design means that it is perfect for those who want a no-nonsense model that is perfect for high gain musical styles, and compact in size to make it exceptionally comfortable to play. As you'd expect from the team at Gretsch, this is a workhorse that is perfect for beginners and gigging pros alike.</p><h3> Sleek Body Profile </h3><p>The body is crafted using laminated maple, a highly resonant tonewood that produces a brilliant high-end energy. The laminate also gives the wood greater resilience with regard to changes in temperature and humidity, making the G2655T a fantastic model for touring with. A lightweight spruce centre block runs along the length of the body internally, which helps to reinforce the body top, whilst suppressing unwanted feedback when you're performing high-gain musical styles. The vintage aesthetic of the G2655T Streamliner is reinforced by the cool walnut stain finish, with elegant two-ply white and black body binding on hand to emphasise the sultry curves of this model. Further protection is afforded to the finish thanks to a layer of gloss.</p><h3> Sturdy and Responsive Nato Neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a reassuringly solid nato neck, which is shaped with a thin """"U"""" profile for increased playing comfort. Paired with the neck is a 22 medium fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with pearloid block inlays to guide your way in style. The fingerboard is shaped with 12-inch radius, guaranteeing that string bends are executed smoothly, whilst your fingers are given a luxurious playground to explore. The double-cutaway body profile enables greater access to the upper frets, giving you total command of the neck and fingerboard.</p><h3> Versatile Broad'Tron Humbuckers </h3><p>The energy produced in the body is harnessed and translated beautifully by the Broad'Tron humbucking pickups. This high-output partnership delivers lows with a thunderous roar, mids with a weighty punch, and highs with a ringing clarity. Whatever style of music you play; the Streamliner is as adaptable as your playing style demands.</p><p>Control comes in the form of independent volume controls for each pickup, a master volume pot, and a master tone pot. There is a three-way pickup selector switch that allows you to select either pickup individually, or both simultaneously. In keeping with the vintage finishing touches, black vintage-style control knobs are on hand for smooth and precise control over your tone.</p><h3> Heavenly Vibrato Control </h3><p>The exceptional playability and control afforded by the G2655T wouldn't be quite the same without the anchored adjusto-matic bridge and Bigsby-Licensed B50 tailpiece partnership. String action adjustment is simple thanks to the bridge, and you can rest assured that tuning stability, intonation and sustain is upheld dutifully thanks the combined effort of the bridge and synthetic bone nut. The Bigsby-Licensed B50 tailpiece is a joy to work with, responding gracefully and returning to its original position quickly.</p><p>The headstock - along with the single-ply black pickguard - proudly bears the gold Gretsch logo, whilst die-cast nickel tuning machines uphold tuning integrity with unwavering accuracy during the most energetic of performances.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gretsch Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,615-615-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/c8e11f81ac77a8fd07b0d008587d426f.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"G2655T Streamliner Bigsby Electric Guitar - Walnut Stain","G2655T Streamliner Bigsby Electric Guitar - Walnut Stain",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Shaped to the Taylor grand symphony body profile, the 326e produces a powerful acoustic output whether it is plugged into an amplifier or played in its natural state. The 326e Baritone-8 LTD is the ideal electro acoustic model for any guitarist looking to galvanise their sonic abilities and techniques with the addition of two extra lower octave strings.</p><h3>GRAND SYMPHONY BODY</h3><p>According to Taylor, the Grand Symphony body can be described as """"a Grand Auditorium with a turbo boost"""". The Grand Symphony is slightly bigger in size with a bigger lower body bout and expanded waist. This enhances the guitar's ability to produce a powerful, full-bodied timbre with plenty of volume. The 326e has the perfect shape for an 8-string guitar as it responds to fast, fingerstyle play as well as big chord strums.</p><p>The body top is constructed from tropical mahogany which is accompanied by Tasmanian blackwood in the back and sides. Tropical mahogany develops and improves with age, while the blackwood contributes to a broad range of tones from beefy mids to sparkling highs, with clarity and warmth to boot. The 326e features Taylor baritone bracing which strengthens the overall body structure.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>As per the body top, tropical mahogany is also used in the neck of the 326e. Its satin finish feels comfortable in your hand, and it is topped with a sumptuous ebony fingerboard. There are 19 frets at your service decorated with delicate, small diamond inlays to guide you up and down the neck. The neck is robust and reliable to withstand having 8 strings, and to play in standard tuning you can put a 12-string capo on the fifth fret. Alternately the guitar comes already tuned from B to B which complements the octave strings which sit alongside the 3rd and 4th strings.</p><h3>ELECTRONICS</h3><p>Taylor have equipped the 326e with the cutting-edge beneath-the-saddle piezo pickup. The Expression System 2 takes on an entirely modern and innovative pickup design as it has three individually calibrated pickup sensors that respond fantastically to each of the strings. It accurately translates the true acoustic timbre of a Taylor guitar through an amplifier, whether you're in the studio or performing live.</p><p>The Expression System 2 has simple controls for Volume and Tone to help shape your sound to suit your playing needs, and with a complex gain configuration you can achieve a sizzling, improved tone.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>Nickel tuners uphold tuning integrity with precision with 8 fitted to the headstock for each string. The body has a black pickguard to defend against scratches, while the soundhole is decorated with a three-ring rosette.</p><p>The satin Shaded Edge Burst finish has a great vintage appearance for an all-round visually pleasing, natural look. The Taylor 326e Baritone-8 LTD is an exceptional electro acoustic guitar that will also get better with age, so to further protect against potential dirt or damage, Taylor include a Deluxe Hardshell case in Brown.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1062-1062-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/adb0926d7cc7a622d0ab808d9f661be0.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 326e Baritone-8 LTD Electro Acoustic Guitar - Shaded Edge Burst","Taylor 326e Baritone-8 LTD Electro Acoustic Guitar - Shaded Edge Burst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

With a size that sits between a Dreadnought and a Grand Concert, this guitar delivers for both flatpickers and finger style players. With this versatility and its capacity to deliver tonal balance with a clear, defined midrange, this is the go-to guitar for those after a multi-purpose instrument that can cover a variety of styles. It also benefits from a Venetian cutaway, giving unrestricted access to the upper register.</p><p>Popularised because of its broad dynamic range and crisp articulation, Sitka spruce offers something to strummers, flatpickers and fingerpickers, making it the perfect top wood for this body shape. It is also noted for improving with age; gaining more character as it is played in. The top has been finished with a beautiful medium brown stain with burst.</p><h3>Tasmanian Blackwood Back &amp; Sides</h3><p>With its cinnamon-red hue and defined grain, the Tasmanian Blackwood used for the Taylor 514ce FLTD Electro-acoustic Guitar's back and sides is wonderfully rich, and alongside the shaded edgeburst of the top, gives a vintage feel to the instrument. Tonally Tasmanian Blackwood is not dissimilar to koa or mahogany, with a focussed mid-range, that is dry and clear as well as warm, it also has the top end shimmer and richness characteristic of rosewood.</p><h3>Expression System 2 Electronics</h3><p>Taylor's latest version of their pickup/preamp pairing has been utilised in the Taylor 514ceFLTD, this time taking the form of the Expression System 2.</p><p>Tailored specifically for use with their instruments, the Expression System 2 takes a pickup, with three individually positioned sensors, and places it behind, rather than underneath, the saddle, to capture more of the guitar's natural tone and responsiveness. This is partnered with a professional-grade preamp to give a truer reflection of the guitar's acoustic sound.</p><p>Like its predecessor, the Expression System 2 keeps control simple and focussed with single Volume and Tone controls. This model also benefits from a reengineered gain structure, which makes it 25% hotter.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1093-1093-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/32b06706c7b4a49f6d6844da5bbec253.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 514ce-FLTD Electro-acoustic Guitar","Taylor 514ce-FLTD Electro-acoustic Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Though it has long been associated with hard rock and metal, it is a much more versatile instrument that is well suited to a wide range of other styles from jazz to blues, prog and grunge. The 2017 HP (High Performance) model is endowed with a selection of premium appointments that makes this the perfect choice for professionals who want a powerful workhorse that is built for life on the road.</p><h3>The Flying V</h3><p>Just looking at the Flying V, it becomes immediately clear as to where its name comes from. Multi-cut mahogany has been employed as the body tonewood, giving the V a commanding mid to low-end energy. Though it comes in at under 4lbs, the guitar produces an enduring sustain. As with other models in the 2017 range, Gibson has increased the comfortability of the guitar by including a sculpted fast-access heel. This accompanies a flat carve body contour and makes it even more enjoyable to wield.</p><h3>Slimtaper Flying V profile</h3><p>Securely fitted to the V-shape body - via a traditional Mortis and Tenon joint with Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive reinforcement - is a single-piece mahogany neck. Shaped to the Flying V slimtaper profile, Gibson have designed this neck with soloists in mind to be a fast and smooth playing dream. Married to the neck is a 22-fret grenadillo fingerboard, which is decorated with Mother-of-Pearl dot inlays to conduct your way up and down the frets with confidence.</p><p>At the top of the neck is an innovative titanium zero-fret adjustable nut, which couples exceptional sustain with outstanding resonance for a rich, full-bodied tone. The zero-fret nut also gives the neck and strings the fastest action to date, perfect for rock guitarists who play at break-neck speeds.</p><h3>Dirty Finger+ pickups</h3><p>The Dirty Fingers+ humbuckers are Ceramic magnet-powered high gain monsters that deliver searing tones to die for. These beauties are perfect for taking centre stage, with a loud and aggressive edge that pushes amps hard - making them a fantastic partner for your tube/valve amp. Beefing up the sustain generated by the body/neck combo, the Dirty Fingers+ sing with absolute clarity.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of newly designed knurled knobs, with added grip to ensure greater precision when making tonal adjustments during energetic sets.</p><h3> Improved G-FORCE auto-tuning </h3><p>Gibson has equipped the 2017 Flying V HP with an updated version of their G-FORCE auto-tuning system. This sits at the back of the headstock, and gives you access to alternate tunings and adjustment with greater speed and accuracy. The improved synchronized spur gear system operates smoothly and quietly, and boasts a highly impressive 40:01 gear ratio - you can rest assured that once your tuning is set, it will remain that way no matter how hard you rock out.</p><h3>Stage-ready hardware</h3><p>The Gibson 2017 Flying V HP is fitted with a chrome-plated Tune-o-Matic bridge with titanium saddles and locking thumbwheels, which is paired with a chrome-plated aluminium stopbar tailpiece with locking studs. The titanium saddles further enhance the sustain and helps to produce a crystal clear, bright sound.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>Each Gibson 2017 Flying V HP Electric Guitar model is supplied with a hardshell case in aluminium to protect your pride and joy whether it is in storage or in transit. With the 2017 model you will also receive a Gibson USA multi tool, premium strap, polishing cloth, and owner's manual to help you to keep your Flying V in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,444-444-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/b67b0ec545a30b30105bb7fb6d30faf1.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 Flying V HP Electric Guitar - Alpine White","Gibson 2017 Flying V HP Electric Guitar - Alpine White",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The smaller Grand Symphony shape combined with the tonewoods gives you a well-balanced acoustic that can adapt to any playing style.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>Firmly joined to the GS Mini-e Walnut body is a 23 1/2 inch scale length sapele neck. The neck is topped with an ebony fingerboard which boasts 20 frets and 4mm dot Italian acrylic inlays act as a handy guide.</p><h3>Electronics</h3><p>Taylor are a pioneer when it comes to considering and creating innovative electronics to amplify their models. The GS Mini-e Walnut is equipped with the Expression System 2 pickup known for its unique behind-the-saddle design. The ES2 has three individually calibrated pickup sensors which are more able in translating the guitar's natural voice. The ES2 pickup works with Taylor's custom-designed """"professional audio""""-grade preamp to give you a responsive, accurate sound. Plus, tweaking your output is made simple thanks to Volume and Tone controls, guaranteeing that the GS Mini-E Walnut sounds excellent through any amp or PA system.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>Taylor chrome tuners are fitted to the headstock to uphold tuning integrity with precision, even after a long set. The GS Mini-e Walnut features a Tusq nut and Micarta saddle that improve sustain and intonation. The natural finish of the GS Mini-e Walnut is complemented with a tortoise-pattern pickguard and a three ring soundhole rosette.

Coming into its 184th year, Martin know a thing or two when it comes to building durable guitars that look as good as they sound, and the 000-17 Whiskey Sunset reaps the rewards of this experience.</p><h3>Auditorium body</h3><p>Martin has employed solid Sitka spruce as the tonewood of choice for the body top. Boasting the enviable combination of resilience, strength, and flexibility, Sitka is a dream soundboard that projects with graceful dexterity. To prevent unwanted buckling or warping, Martin's time-tested scalloped X-bracing is on hand to ensure that the Sitka spruce is suitably reinforced but can resonate unimpeded. Grained Ivoroid binding encircles the body top, which complements the heavenly Whiskey Sunset finish perfectly.</p><p>The back and sides of the guitar are built using mahogany, a naturally dense and warm sounding wood that establishes a hearty mid to low-end timbre. The back and sides have been treated to a satin finish, which prevents tackiness from occurring to ensure a smooth playing feel.</p><h3>Select hardwood neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a select hardwood neck, which is shaped to the modified low oval profile with a high-performance taper. The neck is designed to inspire a fast playing feel, which is enhanced by the addition of a protective satin coating. Married to the neck is a 20-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with Mother of Pearl inlays to guide your way in style.</p><h3>Durable hardware</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a modern straight-line rosewood bridge with drop-in compensated bone saddle. The bridge/saddle partnership creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain. At the top of the neck you'll find the bone nut, which works alongside Golden Age Relic nickel tuning machines to uphold tuning integrity and string tension dutifully.</p><p>Down to the slightest detail Martin have gone to great lengths to ensure everything on the 000-17 comes together to create a stunning work of visual art. The head plate logo style adopts that of authentic 1933 overlay script, with yellow side dot position inlays to complement the Golden Age Relic tuning machines.

The versatile shape has a level of clarity and articulation that is hard to match, and projection that ensures you'll always be heard. This dreadnought also benefits from Taylor's Venetian cutaway, giving unrestricted upper fret access, with a subtle and smooth swooping cut out.</p><p>Another acoustic classic is seen in this model, with the top being constructed of solid Sitka spruce. Combining well with the dreadnought shape, this wood draws out the best from it, with a tone that is focussed and bright. Making up the back and sides of the guitar is solid ovangkol. A wood that is similar to rosewood in its tonal make-up, though with a slightly fuller midrange and a bright, focused top end, ovangkol is very balanced, with a full-spectrum tonal range that is perfect for generalists.</p><p>The guitar's playing surface is combination of a 1-3/4""""-wide tropical mahogany neck joined by a 20-fret ebony fingerboard with progressive dot inlays.</p><h3>Taylor Expression System (ES)</h3><p>The Expression System pickup completes the package by translating a transparent representation of the guitar's beautiful tone through your amplifier or P.A system. This is possible, thanks to the all-magnetic pickup system that functions like a microphone, giving the sound of the guitar, not the pickup. This includes two important elements to capture the full sound of the guitar: a soundboard-mounted Dynamic Body Sensor, and a Dynamic String Sensor, which is embedded beneath the fretboard.</p><p>The other part of the system is the discreet preamp situated at the guitar's upper bout. This is comprised of three simple rotary controls: Volume, Bass, and Treble.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1068-1068-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/75eeb0cae3068a15f493eb79bf463c91.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 410ce Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 410ce Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

This ultra-portable travel mate belies its size with a sweet, full voice and great tone; making it perfect for adults who prefer the comfortable dimensions of a smaller-sized guitar or even as a starter guitar for children.</p><h3>Small but Beautifully Formed</h3><p>The Taylor BT1e uses the classic Dreadnought shape with a solid Sitka spruce top and layered sapele back and sides giving you the full-bodied sound the shape is known for, but in an easier-to-handle, easier-to-transport package.</p><h3>Classic formula</h3><p>A choice tonewood in the construction of acoustic guitars, and a personal favourite of the Taylor founder himself, Bob Taylor, the solid spruce top offers a broad dynamic range, with crisp articulation throughout. It is these properties that see it as the perfect wood to employ in dreadnought construction as it mirrors the shape's universal appeal and versatility; more than capable of holding its own in most genres and with most techniques, from flat picking and fingerpicking right through to heavy strumming.</p><p>Partnering the top are layered sapele back and sides, crafted with a core of poplar, which sits snugly between exterior and interior layers of sapele. The back is also pressed into a slight arch, providing strength and helping produce the instrument's full, rich tone. Having the back and sides constructed in this way keeps the guitar sounding great, whilst ensuring its resilience to changes in environment, notably the differences in humidity when moving between locations. It also keeps the cost down without sacrificing the guitar's stunning good looks.</p><h3>Sapele Neck, Ebony Fingerboard</h3><p>Fitted to the Taylor Baby BT1 is a Tropical American mahogany neck, which actually provides a more colourful tone, in comparison to other neck types. The neck wears an eye-pleasing ebony fingerboard, which easily stands out from the rest of the guitar, whilst also offering a smooth, comfortable playing surface.</p><h3>Taylor expression system baby pickup</h3><p>The inclusion of the ES-B pickup means that all of the effort that has gone into the construction of the BT1e Electro Acoustic Guitar can be faithfully recreated through your choice of amplification.</p><p>The ES-B pickup system incorporates piezo design elements from the Taylor Expression System 2. The preamp system comes with a built in chromatic tuner and features an LED display for easy tuning and low battery indication, along with Tone and Volume controls.</p><p>In summary, the Taylor Baby BT1 Electro Acoustic Guitar offers every feature you could want on an electro acoustic and does so with class, as you would expect from Taylor. If you need a top quality 3/4 size guitar, but don't want the heavy price tag, the BT1e is definitely worth your consideration.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1101-1101-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/658872b75e7f8ead46271f35da3fc344.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor Baby BT1e Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor Baby BT1e Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Built with the finest tonewoods, equipped with gig- and recording-ready hardware, and completed with the highest quality appointments, the 612ce 12-fret is the stuff of dreams. Once you pick it up, you'll wonder how you ever got by without one of these beauties in your arsenal.</p><h3>Grand Concert body</h3><p>The 612ce is shaped to the Grand Concert body profile, which offers a smaller-bodied guitar that is perfect for fingerstyle. Lightweight and compact in shape, it is perfect for those with a shorter playing reach. The 12-fret design harks back to traditional models, with the bridge set slightly further down the lower bout, which enhances the timbre immensely. The playability of the neck is also easier on the fingers thanks to the neck joint placement at the 12th fret rather than the 14th.</p><p>The body back and sides are constructed using revoiced maple, which is designed to enhance warmth, complexity, volume, sustain and responsiveness. The top is built from Sitka spruce (a Taylor favourite), which is reinforced with advanced performance bracing with relief rout. The bracing enables the soundboard to resonate freely to produce an enviable projection. You can rest assured that the subtle nuances of your performance will sing out beautifully.</p><h3>Durable neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body via a scarf joint is a supple yet supportive maple neck. The neck has been treated to a satin finish to prevent unwanted stickiness or tackiness from impeding your movement along the neck. Paired with the neck is a delightful ebony fingerboard, which is adorned with Ivoroid wing inlays to guide your way in style. Ebony binding ensures smooth transitions between each and every fret. The elegantly shaped Venetian cutaway makes it even easier to reach the upper frets.</p><h3>Expression System 2 Electronics</h3><p>Taylor's exclusive Expression System 2 pickup is fitted in the 612ce to give you unparalleled amplification. The ES2 pickup features three uniquely positioned and individually calibrated pickup sensors that faithfully transmit the natural tones of the 612ce through recording equipment or an amplifier. Taylor have patented this behind-the-saddle design and it is one which captures all the tone on offer from the 612ce.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>The gloss body finish protects the aesthetically pleasing brown sugar stain from premature wear, enabling it to age gracefully. Ebony binding encircles the top, whilst an ebony/ivoroid/abalone rosette decorates the soundhole. The ebony bridge features abalone dot bridge pins that complement the striped ebony pickguard. The headstock is fitted with Taylor slot head tuners, which uphold tuning integrity dutifully throughout each and every performance.</p><p>Taylor have ensured that you can keep your 612ce 12-Fret electro acoustic guitar well-protected and safely stored by including a Taylor deluxe hardshell case.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1077-1077-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/d7e1453ad82aa52b3be3f7c09a5027b8.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 612ce 12-Fret Electro Acoustic Guitar - Brown Sugar","Taylor 612ce 12-Fret Electro Acoustic Guitar - Brown Sugar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The Taylor GS Mini-e Mahogany is built to Taylor's uncompromisingly high-standards of quality and can more than hold its own against larger models. </p><p> The top wood is built using Solid Tropical Mahogany, a dense tonewood that delivers a very bright and punchy sound. The Mahogany top gives a short and snappy tone to the guitar but throughout its life can develop into an incredibly warm and natural soundboard. It is well suited to players who are looking for a tone with plenty of individuality and attitude. </p><p> The back and sides are constructed from Sapele laminate, which is composed of a filler layer between an interior and exterior layer of Sapele laminate.

It features a built-in preamp to give the signal a boost, if necessary, and the same active controls for tone and volume that are on the full ES in more expensive models. These are discreetly tucked away so that they don't interfere with your playing, but are there for you to mold your sound to suit your playing needs. </p><p> The Taylor GS Mini-e QS is a beautifully designed little powerhouse that is ready to play straight out of the bag, wherever you are! </p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1113-1113-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/70d31b044276676704f5a8d347597ae7.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor GS Mini-e Mahogany Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor GS Mini-e Mahogany Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The guitar combines the excellent construction quality we've come to expect from such a prestigious manufacturer that incorporates a superb selection of tonewoods and some added features that gives it amazing versatility, at a price you cannot afford to miss. The auditorium body shape is excellent for fingerstyle players, or those who prefer to play a guitar that has a body shape slightly smaller dimensions than those of a dreadnought.</p><p>The 000RS1 is crafted from solid sapele for the back and sides, with a solid Sitka spruce top. The sapele does what it does best, ensuring a very balanced and full-bodied lower frequency response for a pulsing heartbeat. The Sitka spruce top is the perfect counterpoint to the sapele as it ensures the upper frequency range is well represented and can hold its own against the deep timbre of the back and sides.</p><p>Martin's A-frame """"X-1"""" top bracing pattern gives the Sitka spruce top all the support and freedom it needs to resonate fully. As Sitka resonates very efficiently, this gives the 000RS1 a huge dynamic range, allowing you to command your sound with incredible precision.</p><p>The solid rust stratabond and black richlite neck and fingerboard combination serve up a beautiful playing surface to play on. Each note across the fingerboard rings out articulately and the sustain from the neck/body combination allows you to pour your heart and soul into your playing, secure in the knowledge that the 000RS1 will faithfully produce the sound you want with ease.</p><p>The 000RS1 comes fitted with the Fishman Sonitone electronic system. If you need a bit more power for a larger gig the 1'4"""" jack allows you to hook the guitar up to an amp, or whatever else you fancy.</p><p>The black richlite bridge guarantees a seamless connection between your strings and the body - adding to the excellent sustain properties. Chrome enclosed tuning machines with small buttons allow you to make tuning adjustment readily, and otherwise keep your strings securely fastened throughout each performance.</p><p>If you're looking for a high quality, versatile guitar then you've found it in the Martin 000RS1 is. You even get a Martin 330 hardshell case to carry it around in, so as soon as it arrives you're good to go!</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Martin Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,971-971-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/73c9d4f32834effd24f066c65e37fd97.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Martin Road Series 000RS1 Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Martin Road Series 000RS1 Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Comprised of luxurious tonewoods, meticulously crafted hardware, exceptional electronics, and finished to a high standard, this is a model that all guitarists will fall in love with.</p><p>The 214ce-K DLX benefits guitarists who are seeking a model that can be applied to many styles of music. Thanks to its delightful grand auditorium body shape - Taylor's most popular and versatile body shape -, this model has proportions that fall between a dreadnought and a grand concert. The Venetian cutaway ensures greater access to the higher frets, which contributes to making the 214ce-K DLX an excellent choice for both flatpickers and fingerstyle players.</p><h3> Body </h3><p>The layered koa back and sides generate a warm timbre that is projected enthusiastically by the articulate Sitka spruce top - a favourite of Taylor's due to its consistency when it comes to projecting tones with clarity and power. Whether you're strumming hard, or playing deftly picked notes, you can rest assured that the 214ce-K DLX delivers nothing but beautiful notes. The body has received a slender yet resilient gloss finish to prevent tackiness or stickiness from occurring, whilst adding protection to the heavenly natural finish.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a sturdy sapele neck, which has been treated to a satin coating that ensures a smooth playing feel. Married to the neck is a sumptuous ebony fingerboard, which is home to 20-frets that are adorned with small diamond inlays to provide a stylish navigational aid.</p><h3>Electronics</h3><p>The 214ce-K DLX benefits from Taylor's newly designed Expression System 2 (ES2), their behind-the-saddle pickup and custom-designed """"professional-audio""""-grade preamp. As part of their never-ending quest for better tone, they shifted their usual 'under-the-saddle' design as they found that by placing the pickup behind the saddle, a less brittle, brash and synthetic sound could be captured. This means that no matter how aggressively you play, the natural warmth produced by the tonewoods rings out beautifully without colouring the signal or blemishing the natural timbre of the guitar in any way.</p><p>The control layout features the same volume and tone control knobs as on the original Expression System, with Taylor changing the gain structure of the preamp slightly to make it a little hotter. When playing live, this subtle adjustment gives the 214ce-K DLX the boost you need to be heard loud and clear.</p><p>If it's a stylish yet understated model you're looking for, then the Taylor 214ce-K DLX electro acoustic guitar is perfect.

From the tonewoods to the tuning machines, the nuanced control layout to the feel of the neck, everything detail has been pored over by the team at Gretsch to create a guitar that is a professional's dream, and affordable enough for us all to enjoy.</p><h3> Sleek Body Profile </h3><p>The semi-hollowbody design evokes the vintage-style of historical Gretsch models, but is crafted with modern players in mind. The top, back and sides are built from laminated maple, which is known for its highly resonant, bright-sounding character. As the wood is laminated, it holds up well with regard to changes in temperature and humidity, making it a fantastic gigging guitar thanks to its tonal consistency.</p><p>A lightweight spruce centre block runs through the internal length of the body, a useful aid in the top's reinforcement. Not only that, but the centre-block suppresses unwanted feedback, so whilst you're rocking out with all your might, your tone will wail only when you want it to. The vintage aesthetic of the G2655T Streamliner is sealed with a Flagstaff Sunset finish, with elegant two-ply white and black body binding on hand to emphasise the sultry curves of this model. A layer of gloss adds further protection to the finish.</p><h3> Sturdy and Responsive Nato Neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a reassuringly solid nato neck, which is shaped with a thin """"U"""" profile for increased playing comfort. Paired with the neck is a 22 medium fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with pearloid block inlays to guide your way in style. The fingerboard is shaped with 12-inch radius, guaranteeing that string bends are executed smoothly, whilst your fingers are given a luxurious playground to explore. The double-cutaway body profile enables greater access to the upper frets, giving you total command of the neck and fingerboard.</p><h3> Versatile Broad'Tron Humbuckers </h3><p>The energy produced in the body is harnessed and translated beautifully by the Broad'Tron humbucking pickups. This high-output partnership delivers lows with a thunderous roar, mids with a weighty punch, and highs with a ringing clarity. Whatever style of music you play; the Streamliner is as adaptable as your playing style demands.</p><p>Control comes in the form of independent volume controls for each pickup, a master volume pot, and a master tone pot. There is a three-way pickup selector switch that allows you to select either pickup individually, or both simultaneously. In keeping with the vintage finishing touches, black vintage-style control knobs are on hand for smooth and precise control over your tone.</p><h3> Gig-Ready Hardware </h3><p>The body is equipped with an anchored adjusto-matic bridge, which is partnered with a Gretsch """"V"""" stoptail tailpiece to ensure the strings are seamlessly connected to the body. Not only does this create a secure playing feel but - along with the synthetic bone nut -, it also establishes a firm foundation for optimised intonation and sustain. You can bend and hold notes for a long as you wish, and your tones will sing out sweetly. The headstock - along with the single-ply black pickguard - proudly bears the gold Gretsch logo, whilst die-cast nickel tuning machines uphold tuning integrity with unwavering accuracy during the most energetic of performances.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gretsch Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,609-609-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/17b2cb47f182e06025c316bb6f14a2eb.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"G2655 Streamliner Electric Guitar - Flagstaff Sunset","G2655 Streamliner Electric Guitar - Flagstaff Sunset",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The single cutaway body profile makes it significantly easier to reach the upper frets comfortably.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck is a Graph Tech nubone nut, which works in partnership with the vintage-style open-back tuning machines to uphold string tension and tuning integrity.</p><h3> Blacktop Filter'Tron pickups </h3><p>Fitted to the body are two BlackTop Filter'Tron humbuckers in the neck and bridge positions. Designed to enhance the """"fat"""" timbre produced by the body, this pair produce an enviable tonal arsenal for you to play with.

There are 20-frets at your disposal, adorned with twisted oval inlays to guide your way.</p><p>The body and neck are both protected by a gloss finish, preserving the natural beauty of the woods for as long as possible. As well, as providing a layer of security, the gloss also creates a smooth playing feel along the neck, making it much easier to navigate.</p><h3>Electronics</h3><p>The Taylor 610ce is fitted with Taylor's own Expression System 2, which features some interesting improvements following research conducted by Taylor's electronics team.</p><p>Rather than feature an under-saddle pickup - following painstaking research and testing - Taylor have instead placed the pickup behind-the-saddle, featuring three uniquely positioned and individually calibrated pickup sensors. This means that whether you're a heavy hitter or a gentle strummer, thanks to the ES2 electronics system, you'll be able to experience a more natural-sounding, amplified acoustic Taylor, like you've never heard before!</p><p>The onboard control system is still the same with volume and tone controls within easy access, making it incredibly simple to make changes on the fly during gigs or recording sessions.</p><h3>Hardware/Finish</h3><p>The Taylor 610ce is completed with some gorgeous finishing touches to complete the high-quality look and feel of the guitar. Taylor's own gold tuners maintain tuning integrity throughout even the most aggressive of performances with absolute precision. White body binding supports the top and provides a beautiful contrast against the natural spruce. The white traces its way along the neck and around the headstock, which itself is adorned with the signature Taylor logo.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1075-1075-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/3e75af75ba583de5507076f499c6ee6e.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 610ce Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 610ce Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The GS Mini-e Walnut is a new, left handed edition, using striking Walnut tonewood in the back and sides and Taylor's innovative Expression System 2 onboard electronics. The GS Mini-e Walnut appeals to left handed beginners and experts alike thanks to its incredible playability.</p><h3>GS Mini Body</h3><p>The main element of the GS Mini is its scaled-down Grand Symphony body, however that does not mean that the sound has to be scaled down too! This smaller Grand Symphony guitar is considered to be a modern take on a parlour guitar, proving to be just as fun to play at home as it is to take out on the road.</p><p>Taylor have opted for a solid Sitka Spruce top, a popular choice for an acoustic soundboard thanks to its outstanding projection and expansive range of tones. The top is reinforced thanks to X-bracing with Relief Route underneath. The back and sides are made up of Walnut, offering a deep, rich low end and crisp highs with plenty of warmth and clarity. The smaller Grand Symphony profile combined with the tonewoods gives you a well-balanced output that can adapt to any playing style.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>A 23 1/2 inch scale length sapele neck is fitted to the body. The neck is topped with an ebony fingerboard which hosts 20 frets and 4mm dot Italian acrylic inlays provide you with a handy guide for each fret transition.</p><h3>Electronics</h3><p>Taylor are a pioneering brand when it comes to creating innovative electronics to amplify their models. The Expression System 2 pickup known for its unique behind-the-saddle design is employed to amplify the GS Mini-e Walnut. The ES2 has three individually calibrated pickup sensors which are more able in translating the guitar's natural voice. The ES2 pickup works with Taylor's custom-designed """"professional audio""""-grade preamp to give you a responsive, accurate sound. Tweaking your output is easy thanks to the Volume and Tone controls, guaranteeing that the GS Mini-E Walnut sounds excellent through any amp or PA system.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>Tuning with precision is a certainty with the Taylor chrome tuners at the headstock, even after a long set. The GS Mini-e Walnut features a Tusq nut and Micarta saddle that improve sustain and intonation. The natural finish of the GS Mini-e Walnut is complemented with a tortoise-pattern pickguard and a three ring soundhole rosette.

The 2017 J-45 Custom is built by the expert luthiers at the Gibson Acoustic factory in Montana, keeping that round shoulder dreadnought design accompanied by a selection of modern improvements to make this guitar even more appealing.</p><h3>BODY</h3><p>The 2017 J-45 Custom has been skilfully crafted by the professionals based at Gibson's Acoustic factory in Bozeman, Montana. With a radiused, AA-grade Sitka spruce body top with scalloped bracing, projection and acoustic delivery are second to none, sounding perfectly clear and resonant with each note.</p><p>A unique feature of the 2017 J-45 Custom is that its body back and sides are constructed entirely from rosewood. The rosewood and Sitka spruce partner eachother beautifully, offering an alluring appearance which is further complemented by a hand bound trim binding on the body top with extraordinary herringbone detail.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>A single-piece mahogany neck is firmly secured to the body using hot hide glue via a compound dovetail joint.

Gibson have added small, decorative abalone diamond inlays to guide you from one fret to the next.</p><h3>PICKUP SYSTEM</h3><p>Gibson have employed an updated LR Baggs VTC pickup to amplify the 2017 J-45 Custom Rosewood guitar. This built-in pickup system means you can plug in and play anywhere, making any practice session or live performance a doddle. Volume and tone controls can be easily located beneath the soundhole, allowing you to tweak your sound accordingly. The positioning of the LR Baggs VTC pickup is the reason it can accurately capture the soundwaves directly from the guitar soundboard and deliver a resonant acoustic translation.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The headstock is beautifully decorated with cream binding and kitted out high-calibre with Gold Grover Rotomatics tuning keys. The tuners are set to a reliable 14:01 ratio, which, alongside the Tusq nut and saddle ensure consistently accurate tuning and ideal string spacing.</p><p>The body has a richlite bridge, enhancing sustain and resonance. A firestripe pickguard adds a vintage aesthetic to the body, a prime feature that perfectly suits the Vintage Sunburst colour of the guitar.

When it comes to purchasing a timeless acoustic, Martin are without doubt a brand to choose. The DC15ME draws influence from its counterpart, the D-15, which is played by Coldplay's Chris Martin.</p><h3>Dreadnought Cutaway Body</h3><p>The DC15ME has the quintessential dreadnought body profile with a single cutaway. The cutaway shape of the body allows you to reach the upper registers of the neck with real ease. As mentioned, the body of the DC15ME has been constructed entirely from mahogany. This is a rich-sounding tonewood which brings out a naturally warm voice from the guitar. The body top is strengthened by X Bracing made from Sitka Spruce, improving the clarity and sound output.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>A smooth mahogany neck is firmly joined to the body via a traditional Mortise and Tenon joint for a reliable, sturdy build. The neck is shaped to a modified low oval profile which feels extremely comfortable in the hand. The neck is topped with a sumptuous East Indian Rosewood fingerboard, beautifully adorned with abalone Golden Era style diamonds and squares inlays as an easy point of reference. The neck joins the body at the 14th fret, and there are 20 frets in total to enjoy.</p><h3>New Fishman Electronics</h3><p>An innovative feature of the DC15ME is the new Fishman? Matrix VT Enhance onboard electronics. The Matrix VT is the world's best-selling under-saddle pickup with a discreet, unique design. Unlike other electro acoustics, no control holes are cut into the side of the DC15ME, leaving your guitar construction in its natural form. Instead, the controls are mounted beneath the soundhole, allowing you to tweak Volume and Tone with ease. There is also the Enhance blend control on the lower part of the soundhole.

Baggs Lyric pickup translates the acoustic response of the guitar beautifully </li><li>Includes Gibson black hardshell case, and Gibson acoustic owner's manual</li></ul><p>The Gibson 2016 J-45 Progressive Electro Acoustic Guitar in Autumn Burst combines classic design with contemporary features to exceed the demands of today's performers. Artists have been utilising the J-45 for decades due to its beautiful timbre, comfortable playing feel, and resilient ability to sound fantastic night after night. Touring musicians, session guitarists, amateurs and professionals, everyone loves the J-45.</p><h3> New for 2016 </h3><p>The 2016 J-45 Progressive model benefits from a range of unique features that elevates this exceptional guitar to new heights. The headstock is equipped with the Gibson G Force tuning system, which allows players to accurately and efficiently access a wide range of different tunings with ease. The finish has been improved, along with the playing feel of the fingerboard. Aesthetically, the truss rod cover bears a 2016 engraving.</p><h3> Powerful J-45 Body </h3><p>The Gibson J-45 Progressive Electro Acoustic Guitar body sticks to its roots, with a classic combination of two-piece mahogany back with single-ply binding that is paired with a two-piece grade AA Sitka spruce top with 4-ply binding. The woods are held firmly using Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive, whilst allows the woods to resonate freely whilst maintaining maximum support.</p><p>The mahogany works perfectly with the J-45 body profile, creating a powerful and robust timbre that is filled with depth and warmth. The Sitka spruce top is reinforced using scalloped bracing, which encourages projection and resonance whilst minimising buckling or warping of the soundboard over time.</p><p>The top is finished in a heavenly Autumn Burst that is unique to the 2016 model, which has been treated with finer grit sandpaper and polishing compounds for a high gloss finish.</p><h3> Single-Piece Mahogany Neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body via a solid compound dovetail joint - reinforced using hot hide glue - is the sturdy and reliable single-piece mahogany. Shaped to the slim taper profile, the neck feels slender yet thoroughly durable, giving you the confidence to play with freedom.</p><p>Paired with the neck is a richlite fingerboard, which is home to 20-frets that are adorned with mother-of-pearl parallelogram inlays to guide your way in style. The 12-inch fingerboard radius lends itself beautifully to smooth and seamless string bends. At the top of the neck lies the traditional CF-100 headstock, which is angled to Gibson's customary 17-degree to improve string tension - aided directly by the Black Tusq Zero Fret nut.</p><h3> L.R. Baggs Lyric System </h3><p>Taking to the stage is a trouble-free experience thanks to the L.R. Baggs' Lyric system that is fitted to the J-45 Progressive, which includes an internal microphone, a hi-fidelity mic preamplifier, and soundhole volume and presence controls. The Lyric system features unique TRU-MIC noise cancelling technology, which uses the microphones close proximity to the soundboard to reject """"boxy"""" reflections to ensure a much more accurate representation of the guitar's timbre.</p><h3> G-Force Tuning System </h3><p>Fitted to the headstock is the Gibson G-Force Tuning System, which allows you to accurately and efficiently adjust your string tuning to standard, and a range of alternative options. The system can perform around 100 tunings on a single-charge - and should you forget to recharge the battery you can manually adjust the strings. You can even create custom tunings, save them to your G-Force, and recall them at a later date.</p><h3> Gig-Ready Hardware </h3><p>The belly up richlite bridge with adjustable titanium saddles, works perfectly to guarantee optimum intonation and string tension. The 'tortoise teardrop pickguard protects the body around the underside of the soundhole, whilst the included Gibson black hardshell case protects your new pride and joy on the move. Every model is supplied with a Gibson acoustic owner's manual.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,424-424-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/3ea907344acb86aefcb5828dba0dd1dd.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2016 J-45 Progressive Electro Acoustic Guitar - Autumn Burst","Gibson 2016 J-45 Progressive Electro Acoustic Guitar - Autumn Burst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Mahogany has traditionally been used in the production of electric guitars due to its excellent tonal texture. As an acoustic guitar tonewood it delivers a warm low-end with a sweetly resonant character. The 000-15M has a delicately balanced range and manages to produce a smooth, simmering high-end. Though the body is relatively light in comparison to other guitars of a similar size and shape, the 000-15M can certainly project enough volume when it's required.</p><h3>Comfortable profile neck</h3><p>The neck is also made from solid genuine mahogany and works in partnership with the body perfectly, to create a highly resonant surface for the strings to vibrate. The neck is cut to a modified low oval profile and is home to the morado fingerboard with 20 accommodating frets. Diamond and squares position inlays guide your way along the neck.</p><h3>Beauty throughout</h3><p>Tuning integrity is preserved thanks to the combination of nickel open-geared tuning machines with butterbean knobs and the belly style morado bridge. Martin have taken great efforts to ensure that all appointments suit the all-mahogany finish suitably with a delicate single-ring rosette encircling the soundhole, a delmar tortoise colour pickguard protects the underside of the soundhole from unwanted nicks and scrapes and the stripped back look is completed with a barely noticeable - but incredibly resilient - satin finish.</p><p>Finally, your new pride and joy comes with a 330 hardshell case to protect it whilst you're in the studio, at home or venturing to a gig.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Martin Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,927-927-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/6fa6093b3f31e83a7a291918b2f75d99.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Martin 000-15M Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Martin 000-15M Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Having built an outstanding reputation for creating flawless instruments that are as beautiful to look at as they are to play and hear, Taylor consistently pushes the boundaries and strives for perfection with every model they create.</p><p></p><p>The Taylor 812ce's body back and sides have been crafted from Indian rosewood, a delightfully rich and complex tonewood that produces a full and robust mid to low-end force. The top is made from Sitka spruce - a Taylor favourite - due to its excellent resonant properties that enable it to project huge sounds with the greatest of ease. The bright-sounding spruce works in harmony with the body to deliver inspirational tone and projection.</p><p>A gloss finish has been given to the body to protect from unwanted nicks and scrapes that could otherwise occur over the years. It also enables the guitar to cope with changes in humidity and temperature capably, making this a fantastic touring and gigging partner. On this model Taylor have created an even slimmer coating of gloss - down from 6mm to 3.5mm - without sacrificing on its protective abilities.</p><p>The neck is carefully crafted using a tropical mahogany, giving it an unquestionably sturdy feel in the hand. Married to the mahogany is a sumptuous smoked ebony fingerboard, giving a delightful surface to navigate along. The mahogany and ebony combine perfectly to create a highly resonant platform for the strings, guaranteeing that every note rings out with sparkling clarity. The neck has been treated to newly designed Mother-of-Pearl Element position inlays.</p><p>The Taylor 812ce benefits from Taylor's newly designed Expression System 2 (ES2). As part of their never-ending quest for better tone, they shifted their usual 'under-the-saddle' design as they found that by placing the pickup behind the saddle, a less brittle, brash and synthetic sound could be captured. This means that no matter how aggressively you play, the natural warmth produced by the tonewoods rings out beautifully without colouring the signal or blemishing the natural timbre of the 812ce.</p><p>The control layout features the same volume and tone control knobs as on the original Expression System, with Taylor changing the gain structure of the preamp slightly to make it a little hotter. When playing live, this subtle adjustment gives the 812e 12-fret the boost you need to be heard loud and clear.</p><p>Because the, 812ce Electro Acoustic is a guitar you are going to want to keep in peak condition over the years, Taylor have even included a brown Taylor branded deluxe hardcase making this one of the best packages out there for the most discerning of guitarists.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1079-1079-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/d55843ade29ae0bdf4da89b7ae244e69.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 812ce Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 812ce Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The Taylor BT1 uses the classic Dreadnought shape with a solid Sitka spruce top and layered sapele back and sides giving you the full-bodied sound the shape is known for, but in an easier-to-handle, easier-to-transport package. The exact dimensions of the instrument are: Body Length: 15 3/4"""", Body Width: 12 1/2"""", Body Depth: 3 3/8"""".</p><p>A classic tonewood in the construction of acoustic guitars, and a personal favourite of the Taylor founder himself, Bob Taylor, the solid spruce top offers a broad dynamic range, with crisp articulation throughout. It is these properties that see it as the perfect wood to employ in dreadnought construction as it mirrors the shape's universal appeal and versatility; more than capable of holding its own in most genres and with most techniques, from flat picking and fingerpicking, to straight up strumming.</p><p>Partnering the top are layered sapele back and sides, crafted with a core of poplar, which sits snugly between exterior and interior layers of sapele. The back is also pressed into a slight arch, providing strength and helping produce the instrument's full, rich tone. Having the back and sides constructed in this way keeps the guitar sounding great, whilst ensuring its resilience to changes in environment, notably the differences in humidity when moving between locations. It also keeps the cost down without sacrificing the guitar's stunning good looks.</p><h3>Sapele Neck, Ebony Fingerboard</h3><p>Fitted to the Taylor Baby BT1 is a sapele neck, which actually provides a more colourful tone, in comparison to other neck types. The neck wears an eye-pleasing ebony fingerboard, which easily stands out from the rest of the guitar, whilst also offering a smooth, comfortable playing surface.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1099-1099-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/30ca69d929bff0397d94adf76419fb02.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor Baby BT1 Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor Baby BT1 Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Wearing its heritage proudly, the classic adornments we've come to expect from a Les Paul are on offer with a cool single-cutaway profile, luxurious tonewoods, peerless tonal control and resilient hardware. However, Gibson have raised the stakes by making this model exceptionally comfortable, and boasts a playing feel that will have you never wanting to put this beauty down.</p><h3>Sophisticated Les Paul design</h3><p>The heart and soul of the Les Paul tone comes from its tonewoods, and a long standing partnership of mahogany and maple. The body of the Gibson 2017 Les Paul Tribute T is built using a mahogany back, which creates a driving mid to low-end energy, which is tempered by a grade A plain maple top that ensures tonal clarity and articulation is exhibited in the upper mids to high end.</p><p>In order to make the model lightweight and more comfortable to perform with, Gibson have treated the body to a 9-hole weight relief system. The powerful timbre of the guitar is not compromised in any way, which makes this a dream model for those who are seeking a Les Paul that is more forgiving when played over long periods of time.</p><h3> Sturdy and responsive neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid mahogany neck, which has been treated to a slim taper profile to lend its support in creating a delightful playing feel.

The single-cutaway body profile allows you to reach the upper frets with ease, giving you complete freedom to explore the neck in its entirety.</p><p>At the top of the neck you'll find the headstock, which is equipped with vintage-style keystone tuners to uphold tuning integrity with precision. The partnership of tuners and Tektoid nut stabilises string tension to maintain the playing feel across each string throughout even the most energetic of performances. Fitted to the body is an aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with steel thumbwheels, as well as an aluminium stop bar tailpiece with steel posts. The bridge and tailpiece work together harmoniously to optimise intonation and sustain by creating a seamless connection between strings and body.</p><h3>Upgraded electronics</h3><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Tribute T is fitted with an impressive pickup pairing that includes a 490R in the neck position, and a 490T in the bridge position. Control over the pickups comes via independent volume and tone pots for each pickup, as well as a three-way selector switch. To complement the luxurious overall finish, gold """"Top Hat"""" knobs have been employed. The range of tonal colours you have to paint with is astonishing, with murky muddy, fat saturated lows to impeccably polished highs that sing. Whatever style of music you are tackling, the Les Paul Faded T is more than capable of exceeding your expectations.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>To complete the package, the Gibson 2017 Les Paul Tribute T is supplied with a padded gig bag to protect your new pride and joy, as well as get you out on the road asap.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,476-476-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/b5254f91483e837e3ae08c3a3b24d26a.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 Les Paul Tribute T Electric Guitar","Gibson 2017 Les Paul Tribute T Electric Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

As with the Baby, this model has an arched back to provide additional strength and to increase the capacity of its tonal output.</p><p>Also ensuring strength is the incorporation of Taylor's original X pattern with scalloped braces.

Everything about this model screams excellence, and to play one will have you craving the limelight - so it is a good job that each model is supplied with an aluminium travel case and accessory kit.</p><h3>Sublime solidbody</h3><p>The 2018 SG Standard HP raises the bar for SGs in terms of build quality. The body is crafted using mahogany, which establishes a solid midrange tonal foundation. Paired with the body is a visually commanding AA figured maple top, which sets off the spectacular visual aesthetic beautifully. The deep double-cutaway """"horns"""" are present and correct, with sweetly bevelled edges complementing the slimline design to create the unbelievably comfortable playing feel that has drawn so many players to the SG.</p><h3>Fast playing neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a meticulously crafted neck, which is shaped to the slimtaper profile that is paired with the soloist neck width for the perfect balance of speed and accuracy. For unrestricted control over string action and better sustain there is a titanium adjustable nut with locking feature. As ever, the SG rewards fearless players and those who like to rock out in style. Married to the neck is a luxurious rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 24 low profile frets that have been cryogenically treated. The fingerboard is adorned with pearl trapezoid position inlays to guide you along its entire length.</p><h3>'57 Classic humbuckers</h3><p>Gibson have employed a pair of classic humbucker pickups in the 2018 SG Standard HP, with a '57 Classic in the neck position and a Super '57 Classic in the bridge position. The '57 Classic humbuckers are designed to accurately replicate the original PAF-style tone heard on the original SG models.</p><p>However, the modern-day twist on the electronics setup makes the Standard HP a highly adaptable model, expanding the tonal versatility of the SG further than before. The volume pots have push-pull switches to coil tap each pickup, whilst the DIP switch enables a range of tones to be plucked from the humbuckers. Whatever style of music you play, this guitar can traverse any musical landscape with ease.</p><h3>Improved G-FORCE tuning system</h3><p>Gibson's G-FORCE auto-tuning system has also been given an upgrade, so that fast, accurate string tuning is now even easier than ever before. Whether you're playing in standard, using an alternate tuning, or making up your own that you can save and recall at a later time, you'll be amazed at how smoothly the G-FORCE system operates.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The headstock is home to a bell-shaped chrome truss rod cover, whilst the distinctive Gibson logo resides between the tuning machines. The body is home to the chrome finished aluminium Tune-O-Matic bridge with titanium saddles, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar tailpiece. Everything has been designed and fitted to contribute to the SG Standard HP's superb sustain.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,596-596-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/08c9f136f07976171b950ae163e6d87b.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson USA 2018 SG Standard HP Electric Guitar - Hot Pink Fade","Gibson USA 2018 SG Standard HP Electric Guitar - Hot Pink Fade",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The Taylor GS Mini-e Mahogany is built to Taylor's uncompromisingly high-standards of quality and can more than hold its own against larger models. </p><p> The top wood is built using Solid Sitka Spruce, a favoured tonewood of Taylor's due to it's excellent tonal properties. Its combination of strength and elasticity translates into a wide dynamic range, with intricate articulation that works well with a plethora of styles ranging from strumming to fingerstyle. </p><p>The back and sides of the guitar are built using laminate Rosewood. Rosewood has the enviable tonal quality of having delivering a sweet and warm mid range whilst gently stretching beyond into the lower and upper frequency ranges. This gives it a robust yet gentle timbre. The beauty of employing laminate material in the GS Mini means that it is much more resilient than a solid tonewood when dealing with changes in humidity, making it an excellent guitar to take on your travels. </p><p> In addition to the natural sound projection abilities of the tonewoods, the guitar comes with Taylor's ES-T electronics system for times when you wish to play through an amplifier. The ES-T is a single-source, under-saddle transducer with individual response elements for each string. It features a built-in preamp to give the signal a boost, if necessary, and the same active controls that are on the full ES in more expensive models. These are discreetly tucked away so that they don't interfere with your playing. </p><p> The Taylor GS Mini-e RW is a beautifully designed little powerhouse that is ready to play straight out of the bag, wherever you are! </p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1115-1115-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/7a5bc2e5a8bc15d5b48ac6ea229fc198.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor GS Mini-e RW Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor GS Mini-e RW Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Picking up a Custom 22 at the age of fifteen, Myers' love affair with PRS began and his first SE signature model was released in 2010 and each rendition has gone from strength to strength.</p><p>The single-cutaway, semi-hollow body is crafted from mahogany back and sides, married to a bevelled maple top with flame maple veneer. The semi-hollow design is accentuated with an F-hole towards the lower bout. Everything about this body design is geared towards allowing the tonewoods to resonate as fully as possible. The mahogany creates a swelling low-end, whilst the maple cuts through with a distinct clarity through the mids and highs. Thanks to the semi-hollow design, this guitar is a pleasure to wield onstage making it a true performer's instrument. Whether it's practising at home alone or playing a 3-hour set in front of thousands, the Zach Myers' signature offers incredible comfortability.</p><h3>Wide and fat mahogany neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid mahogany neck, shaped to the substantial wide-fat profile. The neck offers a reassuring feel in the hand, with a generous scale length of 24.5"""" for the strings to resonate along. Not along that but the profile makes playing a breeze, with plenty of space to comfortably plant fingers without ever having to overstretch. Married to the neck is a sumptuous rosewood fingerboard, home to 22 inviting frets that are adorned with the customary PRS bird inlays to guide your way.</p><p>The PRS Designed SE245 humbuckers in the neck and bridge positions allow you to draw upon a huge range of tones to explore your own sonic universe. Each pickup has its own individual volume and tone control, allowing you to shape and sculpt your tone exactly how you want. The SE 245 is not a one-trick pony, and in a short space of time you'll quickly find yourself navigating between funk/jazz/country/rock/metal tones with the greatest of ease.</p><h3>Rock solid tuning</h3><p>The Zach Myers' signature model is fitted with the PRS Adjustable Stoptail, which provides a seamless connection between the strings and body. The headstock is fitted with vintage style tuners to keep your tuning secure no matter how enthusiastically you play. The tuners compliment the outstanding finish perfectly, as well as the natural finish on the headstock.</p><p>It is clear to see that the PRS 2017 SE Zach Myers' signature model has been built to the specs set out by a touring guitarist.

The 618e is built to the Grand Orchestra body profile, Taylor's most recent guitar shape which delivers with intense resonance. Taylor describe the 618e as being like a grand piano in guitar form, constructed using premium tonewoods to generate a well-balanced acoustic timbre.</p><h3>GRAND ORCHESTRA BODY</h3><p>The Grand Orchestra body profile is the newest of Taylor's shapes and it is also the biggest. Its larger size enables it to produce a compelling range of tones, all with plenty of volume. The 618e also features Advanced Performance bracing with relief rout which provides the body with more strength as well as enhancing the soundboard's ability to move, consequently the overall tone and sustain are improved.</p><p>Sitka spruce is the tonewood of choice in the body top and it is """"roasted"""" to stimulate the natural aging process of the guitar. This provides the 618e with a dynamic response and a tone that resembles an older guitar. The back and sides are constructed using maple which is given a hand-rubbed, unique """"Brown Sugar"""" finish. The pairing of spruce and maple add magnitude to the tones made available, providing clarity and ultimate tonal versatility.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>Hard rock maple is used in the neck and given a smooth, satin finish and scarf neck joint. The neck feels incredibly comfortable and is certainly built to last. Topping the neck is an ebony fingerboard with 20 frets at your service. The decorative grained ivoroid wing inlays guide you from one fret to another with total confidence.</p><h3>ELECTRONICS</h3><p>The Expression System 2 electronics fitted in the 618e are an innovative creation by Taylor. This preamp takes the piezo pickup and gives it a modern twist to improve the amplification of the 618e. Unlike many other electro acoustic models, the Taylor 618e has a piezo pickup which is in fact behind the saddle, with three individually calibrated sensors that meticulously transfer the guitar's natural tone through an amp.</p><p>The preamp has controls for Volume and Tone which allow for simple command of your tone.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The back of the headstock features an ornamental grained ivoroid wing inlay while the nickel tuners uphold tuning integrity with precision. The natural finish of the body top is accompanied by an ebony / ivoroid rosette and a striped ebony pickguard, protecting the soundboard against scratches.</p><p>Taylor include a Deluxe Hardshell case in Brown to shield the guitar when in storage or taken on the road. The Taylor 618 is a superior electro acoustic model that produces a full-bodied acoustic voice across the frequencies.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1080-1080-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/528708dd1f841e4dca8557e1e10024bb.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 618e Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 618e Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

So when it came to working with a manufacturer to build his signature model, who better than Ibanez - a company who have been responsible for building iconic guitars for many musical pioneers, including: Joe Satriani; Steve Vai; Paul Gilbert; as well as Marten Hagstrom and Fredrik Thordendal (Meshuggah). When it comes to crafting sublime signature models that adhere strictly to the artist's vision, Ibanez exceed expectations every time. The Ibanez JBM20 Jake Bowen Signature Electric Guitar in Matte Black isn't just a powerful guitar that plays like a dream, but it looks absolutely stunning too. </p> <h3> Sleek RGA Body Shape </h3> <p> The body is modelled on the RGA body shape - itself modelled on the classic RG body shape -, which means it benefits from sleekly contoured curves, with deep double-cutaways, and a beautiful arched top. The body back is shaped from mahogany to establish a substantial mid to low-end energy, with an enviable sustain that carries warmth and power. Married to the mahogany is a delicately shaped maple top to guarantee a balanced resonance, and brilliant clarity across the upper mid to high-end frequency range. Simply put, the tonewood combination gives the JBM20 a generous output that is powerful yet nuanced. </p> <h3> Wizard III 3-Piece Maple Neck </h3> <p> To facilitate a fast and free playing-feel, Ibanez has employed their Wizard III neck profile across the three-piece maple neck. Built with durability, stability and resonance in mind, the neck feels exceptionally comfortable, enabling your hand to glide along with ease. Paired with the neck is a luxurious rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 24 jumbo frets - with a unique 12th fret inlay -, that are bound in order to accommodate seamless transitions between each fret. </p> <h3> Jake Bowen Signature Pickups </h3> <p> Bowen's signature model wouldn't quite be the same without his signature DiMarzio Titan pickups, and the JBM20 is fitted with one each in the neck and bridge. The bridge pickup produces a tight and aggressive response, which is perfect for executing deep chugging palm mutes, and is great for choppy rhythm licks. The neck pickup delivers a punchy sound output with a fat response without ever becoming muddy, making it perfect for searing leads and brilliant clean tones.

Released at the 1987 Chicago NAMM Show, the Steve Vai-designed JEM marked a major turning point in the history of Ibanez, and the development of the electric guitar. Becoming an icon to rival other models, the JEM has gone on to spawn the ever-popular RG series, which is only second to another legendary model. Staking its place in musical history, the Ibanez JEM777 is a heavenly guitar that fortunately us mere mortals can play, and with this very special 30th Anniversary model, we are truly spoilt. </p> <h3> Unique JEM body design</h3> <p> The body is shaped to the same ergonomically designed profile as the original. With gentle bevelled edges and curves in all the right places, this is a model that sits as sweetly during performances for maximum playing comfort. Vai was perplexed by the way other models impeded access to the upper frets, hence the deep double-cutaway that opens the fretboard in its entirety for you to explore. </p> <p> The body is crafted from basswood, a medium-weight tonewood that boasts a well-defined midrange energy with subtle low-end power. The highs like to sizzle before never overpower the timbre, and are never harsh on the ears. Each note is given the space it deserves, ensuring an articulate output across the frequency spectrum. The body is equipped with a pickguard to protect areas around the control knobs and the underside of the strings. Finally, we can't forget the distinctive Vai-designed 'monkey grip' located above the strings, which allows you to carry the guitar easily. </p> <h3> Lightning fast JEM 5-piece maple/walnut neck </h3> <p> The neck is shaped to the lightning fast JEM profile. Crafted from a 5-piece combination of maple and walnut, this is a virtuoso's dream, thanks to the razor thin dimensions that allow your finger to soar. If you're looking for a dream neck to play heavenly sweeps on, then this is the neck for you. </p> <p> A luxurious maple fingerboard is married to the neck, adorned with the truly unique disappearing pyramid inlay, guiding your way in beautiful style. The inclusion of 6105 frets guarantee exceptionally smooth string bends, whilst the Prestige fret edge treatment promises seamless transitions between frets. Not only that but delicate scalloping between the 21st and 24th frets gives unrivalled control and ease of access to the upper frets. </p> <h3> DiMarzio Evolution pickups </h3> <p> To cover the versatile range of tones that Vai is known for producing, DiMarzio Evolution pickups are utilised in the neck, middle and bridge positions. The neck and bridge pickups are passive/ceramic humbuckers and the middle pickup is a passive/alnico single-coil. The 5-way selector switch allows you to pull a wide array of tones from this pickup compliment - from gentle soft-rock tones, tight and clean jazz lick, dense hard rock and ear-piercing metal. Simply put, if you're a session player or a guitarist who likes to mix it up, the Evos have got you covered! </p> <h3> Life-changing Lion's Claw </h3> <p> The JEM777 was designed with the unique Lion's Claw tremolo cavity, which allowed the Edge tremolo to wail as well as dive, lending itself perfectly to Vai's enigmatic playing style. Thanks to the tuning machine, locking nut, and Edge bridge partnership, once you are tuned up and locked in, you can rest assured that tuning integrity, intonation and sustain will remain faithful throughout the most energetic of performances. </p> <p> For protection on the go, a specially designed hardshell case is included to protect your pride and joy from unwanted bumps and scrapes. The Ibanez JEM777 30th Anniversary Edition Electric Guitar is supplied with Certificate of Authenticity (Tour Pass), whilst a JEM 30th Anniversary logo neck plate adds an extra special finishing touch. </p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Ibanez Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,774-774-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/8718ed8147546870494a611e3f0cec7d.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Ibanez JEM777 30th Anniversary Edition Electric Guitar - Shocking Pink","Ibanez JEM777 30th Anniversary Edition Electric Guitar - Shocking Pink",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Since its inception decades ago, the SG has been adopted by players across all musical genres, helping them to push the limits of their playing and break musical boundaries in the process. The 2017 Faded T channels the energy and comfortability the SG is regarded for, and adorns it with a laid bare finish.</p><h3>Legendary Gibson build and SG style</h3><p>As one might expect, the 2017 SG Faded T body is fashioned from mahogany and shaped to the ever so comfortable double-cutaway profile. The slender body depth makes it a joy to wield, and everyone from beginners to seasoned professionals adore how delightfully easy to body is to work with.

Working closing with the tuning machines is the specially designed Tektoid nut, both working dutifully to uphold tuning integrity and string tension. Fitted to the body is the aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with steel thumbwheels, and aluminium stop bar tailpiece with steel posts - both contributing to the optimisation of intonation and sustain.</p><h3>Chunky, funky tones</h3><p>The solid mahogany body creates the smooth timbre, which the pickup partnership delivers with aplomb. Fitted in the neck position is the 490R, and in the bridge position is the 490T. Control comes in the form of independent volume and tone pots for each pickup, which allows you to sculpt and carve your output with precision. Not only that but in keeping with classic SG style, black Top Hat knobs have been fitted.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>The Gibson 2017 SG Faded T Electric Guitar is supplied with a padded gig bag to protect your new pride and joy, as well as get you out on the road asap.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,491-491-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/df7b65f366e1edc63f04f9c013aad1d3.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 SG Faded T Electric Guitar - Worn Cherry","Gibson 2017 SG Faded T Electric Guitar - Worn Cherry",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Another trait of the Grand Concert body shape is a slightly wider neck, which is perfect for complex finger-style playing. This, however, is not a limiting factor with the Taylor 522e 12-Fret, as it performs equally well as a strumming guitar as it does for fingerpicking.</p><p>With an all-mahogany body, the Taylor 522e 12 Fret Electro Acoustic Guitar is as distinctive tonally as it is visually, with its offering of meaty midrange character. Combined with the smaller body size this sound becomes very focussed, giving you the best of both the wood and the body shape. The guitar is beautifully understated with appointments including: ivoroid binding and rosette, ivoroid Century fretboard inlays, and a black pickguard.</p><h3>Taylor Expression System 2</h3><p>Ensuring you get the best from their own instruments, Taylor has created its own pickup design, which continues to improve. It is the updated version of this technology that you'll find in the Taylor 522e 12Fret Electro Acoustic Guitar; the Taylor Expression System 2.</p><p>Through their research Taylor found the best position for the pickup to be is behind the saddle, rather than under it, and they have repositioned theirs accordingly. The pickup in the guitar is made up of three sensors, which are installed through the bridge to ensure the voice of the Taylor 522e 12-Fret Electro Acoustic Guitar remains true when it is put through an amp, PA system or directly into recording software. Discreetly situated at the upper bout of the guitar you will find volume, treble, and bass controls.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1096-1096-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/8abfbb135204c38ac8f381c8a96b17e1.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 522e 12-Fret Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 522e 12-Fret Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Tremonti has sold millions of albums all over and played in titan rock bands such as Creed and Alter Bridge. Now PRS have honoured him again in the form of a Custom Limited Run guitar.</p><h3>SE Tremonti Body</h3><p>Fans of both Tremonti and PRS know exactly what to expect in terms of the shape of the guitar's body. Featuring a single cutaway, the body provides you with full access to the higher registers of the neck. The body is constructed entirely from mahogany, using a thick cut of this elegant-sounding tonewood to produce a warm tone that rings on with lengthy sustain.</p><p>PRS have released a new range of guitars which feature new exotic body tops, and this particular model is fitted with a striking Zebrawood top. The finely striped pattern shines through the guitar's natural finish and it looks just sublime.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>The SE 2017 Tremonti Custom is fitted with a slick maple neck which is shaped to a wide-thin profile which is accommodating for any player to enjoy any style.

The frets are decorated with the customary PRS bird inlays.</p><h3>Accomplished Tremonti Electronics</h3><p>Mark Tremonti is capable of creating a wide range of sounds, from sizzling solos to crystal clear, intricate fingerpicking. To best transfer this sound, he has chosen Tremonti """"S"""" bass and treble humbucker pickups to amplify this Limited Edition model. Featured in the neck and bridge positions, these powerful humbuckers have been made to Tremonti's desired specifications to deliver great tone and sustain. Controls include an individual volume and tone control for each pickup, and a 3-way toggle pickup switch.</p><h3>PRS Hardware</h3><p>Despite the Tremonti Custom coming in at a fairly low and affordable price, the hardware is still superb quality. Fitted to the lower bout of the body is a PRS patented tremolo bridge which has a Trem-Up route, so you can bend the tremolo arm in various directions to perform bends and dive bombs. The headstock has the classic curved shape and is equipped with reliable nickel tuners.</p><p>As soon as you play the PRS SE 2017 Tremonti Custom Limited Run electric guitar, you will be astounded at its outstanding sound and quality appointments for such a low price.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,PRS,TRUE,,,,,,,1002-1002-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/3fff7e8600c00bb5ed4d03a2d2ea55f1.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"PRS SE 2017 Tremonti Custom Limited Run Electric Guitar - Zebrawood","PRS SE 2017 Tremonti Custom Limited Run Electric Guitar - Zebrawood",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

It is built using tonewoods of the highest quality and plays host to a wealth of beautiful finishing touches.</p><p></p><p>The Taylor 322e has been built with the small-body Grand Concert shape, which was designed to meet the needs of delicate fingerstyle players - who wanted a gentler and more articulate sounding instrument compared to the traditional dreadnought shape. The Grand Concert design features a compact body size and tapered waist to keep overtones limited. It has a wider neck that allows intricate fingerings to be played over a very comfortable surface area. The shortened scale length of the neck - 24-7/8"""" - reduces string tension, which means less effort goes into fretting notes and makes the guitar much easier to play.</p><p>The top wood is built using solid tropical mahogany, a dense tonewood that delivers a very bright and punchy sound. The mahogany top gives a short and snappy tone to the guitar but throughout its life can develop into an incredibly warm and natural soundboard. It is well suited to players who are looking for a tone with plenty of individuality and attitude. The top is reinforced with forward-shifted bracing that features Taylor's patented relief rout. The relief rout allows the stiff mahogany to resonate with greater flexibility, without sacrificing structural integrity.</p><p>The back and side wood of the 322e is built using West African sapele wood, which has been utilised by Taylor for over a decade. Sapele is known for having similar harmonic qualities to mahogany in delivering soothing lows and warm mid tones. It is a very-adaptable tonewood that supports a variety of styles from fingerstyle to strumming.</p><p>The combination of the mahogany top and sapele back and sides creates a guitar with a high degree of low-end depth that is matched with a bright and snappy upper midrange. The body is bound in black to protect the edges from chips and damage. A black pickguard protect the top of the body beneath the strings.</p><p>The neck is constructed from reassuringly unyielding tropical mahogany. Coupled with an ebony fingerboard - that is home to 20 frets - the sonic properties of both woods marry together beautifully to complete the delivery of superbly resonant tones with the softened mid range.</p><p>The strings are held in tune by Taylor's reliable chrome tuners, and meet the body via the Tusq nut and saddle who both ensure string action is acutely maintained.</p><h3>Electronics</h3><p>Taylor have done their utmost to ensure that the unique acoustics and timbre of the guitar are as closely represented as possible when it is plugged-in, as to when it is played acoustically. To guarantee this, Taylor spent several years working in collaboration with renowned audio pioneer Rupert Neve to design and perfect their groundbreaking Expression System ? (ES). </p><p>The ES is an all-magnetic acoustic guitar pickup that sits near the soundboard, which acts like a microphone to a produce an exact representation of the acoustics of the guitar. The ES is incredibly simple to command by using the onboard system comprised of three simple controls</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1053-1053-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/545d9bdb86334314d490f19fc510a8a2.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 322e Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 322e Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Picking up a Custom 22 at the age of fifteen, Myers' love affair with PRS began and his first SE signature model was released in 2010 and each rendition has gone from strength to strength.</p><p>The single-cutaway, semi-hollow body is crafted from mahogany back and sides, married to a bevelled maple top with flame maple veneer. The semi-hollow design is accentuated with an F-hole towards the lower bout. Everything about this body design is geared towards allowing the tonewoods to resonate as fully as possible. The mahogany creates a swelling low-end, whilst the maple cuts through with a distinct clarity through the mids and highs. Thanks to the semi-hollow design, this guitar is a pleasure to wield onstage making it a true performer's instrument. Whether it's practising at home alone or playing a 3-hour set in front of thousands, the Zach Myers' signature offers incredible comfortability.</p><h3>Wide and fat mahogany neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid mahogany neck, shaped to the substantial wide-fat profile. The neck offers a reassuring feel in the hand, with a generous scale length of 24.5"""" for the strings to resonate along. Not along that but the profile makes playing a breeze, with plenty of space to comfortably plant fingers without ever having to overstretch. Married to the neck is a sumptuous rosewood fingerboard, home to 22 inviting frets that are adorned with the customary PRS bird inlays to guide your way.</p><p>The PRS Designed SE245 humbuckers in the neck and bridge positions allow you to draw upon a huge range of tones to explore your own sonic universe. Each pickup has its own individual volume and tone control, allowing you to shape and sculpt your tone exactly how you want. The SE 245 is not a one-trick pony, and in a short space of time you'll quickly find yourself navigating between funk/jazz/country/rock/metal tones with the greatest of ease.</p><h3>Rock solid tuning</h3><p>The Zach Myers' signature model is fitted with the PRS Adjustable Stoptail, which provides a seamless connection between the strings and body.

The Martin LX1E """"Little Martin"""" electro acoustic guitar is a beautifully designed travel-sized guitar that packs tonnes of power into a compact, perfectly-formed instrument.</p><p>The top is built from solid sitka spruce, a North American tonewood that is a popular choice in the construction of high-end acoustic guitars. Sitka spruce has the enviable combination of resilience, strength and elasticity, which gives the guitar a range of diverse tonal qualities from deep lows, through warm mids to crisp highs. The top is reinforced using Martin's modified X series """"X"""" bracing technique, giving further strength to prevent any chance of buckling over time, as well as giving a very secure feel to the body.</p><p>The back and sides of the guitar are built from mahogany high-pressure laminate, which offers up all the wonderfully resonant tones you'd expect from such a dense tonewood. Thanks to the laminate it can withstand temperature and humidity differences much more capably than a non-laminate, making it ideal for those who want a guitar that travels well.</p><p>The neck is cut to the very comfortable-to-play modified low oval profile. It is made from rust stratabond, a dye impregnated wood veneer that has now been utilised by Martin for their guitar necks due to its excellent durability and strength. As an alternative to traditional rosewood or ebony, the fingerboard is made from richlite. This is a lightweight composite material that is held in high regard due to its incredible strength, which adds to the integrity of the neck.</p><p>The neck has a generous 23"""" scale length, which is home to 20 very playable frets. The fingerboard width at the nut is 1-11/16"""" extending to 2-1/6"""" at the 12th fret, giving a very comfortable playing surface.</p><h3>Electronics</h3><p>The Martin LX1E is fitted with the Fishman Isys T electronics system, which houses a built-in seven segment chromatic tuner, an EQ tone shaping control, a volume control switch and phase control.</p><p>The Tone control can be attenuated to help deliver a thicker or punchier sound. You can also drop out the midrange when finger-picking and add more depth for times when you want to strum hard. The phase control can be used to improve bass response at low volume and suppress feedback at high volume.</p><h3>Finish</h3><p>The guitar is finished to Martin's high standards with a white corian nut, a black richlite bridge and a white tusq compensated saddle.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Martin Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,959-959-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/d2de908ceb8c001ebd1fc1dcb65292c0.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Martin LX1E Little Martin Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Martin LX1E Little Martin Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

This astonishing guitar was the brainchild of car designer Ray Dietrich who worked alongside Ted McCarty (the then Gibson President). With its unique shape derived from car tailfins, this new Gibson was a revolution, and the 2018 rendition keeps many of the original historic features with some new improvements.</p><h3>Slim and lightweight body</h3><p>Unlike guitars at the time of its birth in the early 1960s, the Firebird had a reverse-style body and a longer right horn, which it retains today. The neck-through-body is constructed from mahogany, a preferred tonewood for Gibson. The mahogany body feels lightweight and comfortable, reducing fatigue especially for performers and live musicians.</p><h3>All mahogany neck</h3><p>As mentioned, the 2018 Firebird has a neck-through-body construction, which boosts sustain and grants full access to all the frets, even the upper registers. The neck is made up of mahogany and shaped to the classic Firebird Slim Taper profile for a faster, more comfortable feeling for the modern guitarist.</p><p>The neck is topped with a thick granadillo fingerboard providing you with 22 frets that have been cryogenically treated to enjoy maximum durability. The use of the thicker granadillo boosts tonal depth produced by the guitar for a high quality sound output. Gibson have fitted a Tektoid nut that is self-lubricating for a better return to pitch and improved sustain.</p><h3>Classic Mini humbuckers</h3><p>The 2018 Firebird is equipped with a pair of Mini Humbucker pickups, with one in the neck position and another in the bridge position. The original Firebirds were also fitted with this superb pickup duo, and the 2018 version will still deliver those PAF-style authentic Gibson tones.</p><p>Featuring the usual controls for rhythm and lead Volume and Tone and a 3-way toggle pickup switch, you can shape your tone to suit your playing needs. Each control has a black tophat with a silver insert, complementing the ebony finish.</p><h3>Exceptional hardware</h3><p>The Firebird headstock is directly fitted with the exceptional mini grover tuning keys. Their excellent design and precise ratio ensure consistency in tuning each string as well as improving the overall sustain. To further boost sustain and resonance there is a traditional chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge and an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece.</p><p>To protect and complement the body's smooth finish is a 3-ply white Firebird pickguard with the quintessential red Firebird on it. To enable the guitarist to look after this wonderful guitar as best as possible, Gibson include a brown Firebird hardshell case as well as an accessory kit so that you can play your new pride and joy right away.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,567-567-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/a85b3f2a8deccdb896ead13c0e36fbc9.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson USA 2018 Firebird Electric Guitar - Ebony","Gibson USA 2018 Firebird Electric Guitar - Ebony",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Martin's X Series was initially introduced in the late 90s and each model from the range was designed with the intention of retaining all of the high-calibre, captivating qualities and features of a Martin guitar but at a more affordable price. The Martin Westside Custom Sapele Edition II is a magnificent electro acoustic guitar which has been built using a culmination of premium materials but at a modest price.</p><h3>TRADITIONAL DREADNOUGHT PROFILE</h3><p>The dreadnought body shape was created and developed by Martin themselves originally in 1916. Since then, it has undoubtedly become one of the world's most revered guitar profiles. The DX1SAE dreadnought model has the capacity to generate a full-bodied acoustic timbre with plenty of sustain. To partner this body frame, Martin have employed a solid sapele soundboard on the Westside Custom Edition which is a pragmatic choice due to sapele being an all-purpose and sustainable type of tonewood.</p><h3>TONEWOOD BLEND</h3><p>Martin have elected a black high pressure laminate tonewood to make up the back and sides of the DX1SAE. High pressure laminate is a composite blend of paper and resin and has a durable, sturdy feel.</p><p>A birch laminate neck is firmly joined to the body of the Westside Custom Edition II guitar and had a modified low oval shape which feels exceptionally strong and robust but also comfortable. Atop of the neck is a 20-fret richlite fingerboard with a 25.4 inch scale length, and when incorporated with the neck profile it allows you to easily glide along the frets smoothly and confidently.</p><h3>FISHMAN SONITONE PREAMP</h3><p>Beneath the soundhole, Martin have equipped the Westside Custom Edition II guitar with the Fishman Sonitone preamp. The preamp has subtle volume and tone controls which are easy to adjust under the soundhole to suit your playing needs. The Fishman Sonitone pickup does a splendid job of converting the acoustic sounds and tones of your guitar when plugged into any amplifier in any room or venue.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>Martin have decorated the DX1SAE with an inlaid soundhole rosette and Delmar tortoise pickguard which both complement the appearance of the guitar. To the lower bout of the guitar is a 1 style belly bridge constructed from richlite like that of the fretboard, and it upholds a firm connection between the body and the strings for a clear-cut timbre.</p><p>Beneath the soundhole inside this incredible guitar is a Martin Custom Edition label to set this model apart from its counterparts.</p><p>The Martin Westside Custom Sapele Edition II is an absolutely first-rate electro acoustic guitar which comes off the back of almost two centuries of guitar creation and development. The Martin DX1SAE is a premium quality electro acoustic guitar which is given a more economical price that anyone can take advantage of.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Martin Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,965-965-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/22e951ddb72ee29296d7ddb9c9b78891.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Martin Westside Custom Sapele Edition II Electro Acoustic Guitar","Martin Westside Custom Sapele Edition II Electro Acoustic Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The guitar's unique design means that it is perfect for those who want a no-nonsense model that is perfect for high gain musical styles, and compact in size to make it exceptionally comfortable to play. As you'd expect from the team at Gretsch, this is a workhorse that is perfect for beginners and gigging pros alike.</p><h3> Sleek Body Profile </h3><p>The body is crafted using laminated maple, a highly resonant tonewood that produces a brilliant high-end energy. The laminate also gives the wood greater resilience with regard to changes in temperature and humidity, making the G2655T a fantastic model for touring with. A lightweight spruce centre block runs along the length of the body internally, which helps to reinforce the body top, whilst suppressing unwanted feedback when you're performing high-gain musical styles. The vintage aesthetic of the G2655T Streamliner is reinforced by the sophisticated black finish, with elegant two-ply white and black body binding on hand to emphasise the sultry curves of this model. Further protection is afforded to the finish thanks to a layer of gloss.</p><h3> Sturdy and Responsive Nato Neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a reassuringly solid nato neck, which is shaped with a thin """"U"""" profile for increased playing comfort. Paired with the neck is a 22 medium fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with pearloid block inlays to guide your way in style. The fingerboard is shaped with 12-inch radius, guaranteeing that string bends are executed smoothly, whilst your fingers are given a luxurious playground to explore. The double-cutaway body profile enables greater access to the upper frets, giving you total command of the neck and fingerboard.</p><h3> Versatile Broad'Tron Humbuckers </h3><p>The energy produced in the body is harnessed and translated beautifully by the Broad'Tron humbucking pickups. This high-output partnership delivers lows with a thunderous roar, mids with a weighty punch, and highs with a ringing clarity. Whatever style of music you play; the Streamliner is as adaptable as your playing style demands.</p><p>Control comes in the form of independent volume controls for each pickup, a master volume pot, and a master tone pot. There is a three-way pickup selector switch that allows you to select either pickup individually, or both simultaneously. In keeping with the vintage finishing touches, black vintage-style control knobs are on hand for smooth and precise control over your tone.</p><h3> Heavenly Vibrato Control </h3><p>The exceptional playability and control afforded by the G2655T wouldn't be quite the same without the anchored adjusto-matic bridge and Bigsby-Licensed B50 tailpiece partnership. String action adjustment is simple thanks to the bridge, and you can rest assured that tuning stability, intonation and sustain is upheld dutifully thanks the combined effort of the bridge and synthetic bone nut. The Bigsby-Licensed B50 tailpiece is a joy to work with, responding gracefully and returning to its original position quickly.</p><p>The headstock - along with the single-ply black pickguard - proudly bears the gold Gretsch logo, whilst die-cast nickel tuning machines uphold tuning integrity with unwavering accuracy during the most energetic of performances.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gretsch Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,618-618-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/660c6a94c88db5245f2da36b6276f995.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"G2655T Streamliner Centre-Block Bigsby Electric Guitar - Black","G2655T Streamliner Centre-Block Bigsby Electric Guitar - Black",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Also the body's back has been pressed out into a slight arch, adding strength, comfort, and a fuller tone.</p><p>A narrower than usual, 1 11/16-inch, sapele neck makes for easy, comfortable play and it is topped by a 20-fret, ebony fingerboard with 6mm dot inlays.</p><h3>Taylor ES-T electronics</h3><p>The Taylor 114ce Electro Acoustic Guitar connects easily to an amplifier or P.A system, thanks to the installed ES-T under-saddle transducer pickup system, which includes a Phase switch for feedback control (located on the preamp board inside the soundhole).</p><p>The preamp is a simple, unobtrusive set of three rotary dials, with a custom-voiced EQ (comprised of bass and treble) and a volume control alongside a low-battery LED indicator.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1018-1018-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/fd4c011d9fe547064db0744ee53d3fbf.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 114ce Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 114ce Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The Academy 12e-N is a left handed electro acoustic nylon-string Grand Concert model, and it is potentially the best nylon-string guitar you will get at this price on the market right now.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>The left handed Academy 12e-N has a Grand Concert, smaller body design, improving comfort alongside the nylon strings which feel a little easier on the fingertips. The body features a tapered waist, and an ergonomic armrest is built into the body to further improve the playing feel.</p><p>The soundboard is constructed from a natural hybrid of Sitka and White spruce known as Lutz Spruce. The spruce provides a dynamic response and a strong attack as well as spacious, clear projection. Beneath the soundboard the Academy 12e-N features internal bracing to add warmth to your sound, working with the mellow tone of the nylon strings for fingerpicking and strumming. Layered sapele makes up the back and sides of the Academy 12e-N which has a striking appearance and a sturdy playing feel.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>The Academy 12e-N is firmly joined with a smooth, patented mahogany neck via a scarf neck joint. Topping the neck is an ebony fingerboard with decorative 4mm dot inlays to guide you throughout each fret transition with confidence.</p><h3>ES-B Electronics</h3><p>The Academy 12e-N is fitted with the ES-B pickup / preamp combo, a blend of Taylor's Expression System 2 piezo design with a built-in digital chromatic tuner. The ES-B preamp has an LED display allowing you to easily see when you are retuning your strings, and it conveniently shows the live battery status. The Tone and Volume controls allow you to easily tweak your tone to suit your playing needs. The preamp requires just two button cell 3v lithium batteries which will then give you around 300 hours of use; so from the practice session through to the live gig you can be sure that you won't have a power out. The ES-B preamp can automatically switch itself off when it is not in use for over three minutes to conserve battery power.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>Nylon nickel tuners with pearloid buttons align the headstock to ensure that superb Academy Series sound is as accurate as possible. A Tusq nut and saddle works with the tuners and bridge to augment sustain of the nylon strings. Each Academy 12e-N comes supplied with a lightweight gig bag for protection when travelling with your guitar out on the road. The Taylor Academy 12e-N is a sublime left handed electro acoustic at a remarkable price for the quality on offer, ideal for fans of nylon-string acoustics or for anyone looking for a change from the usual steel-string models.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1040-1040-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/6fc341e5911f55a1aea377694e0cbe33.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 2017 Academy 12e-N Left Handed Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 2017 Academy 12e-N Left Handed Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The neck also features a Tektoid nut which lubricates itself, consequently improving sustain and ensuring accuracy when returning to pitch.</p><h3>Burstbucker power</h3><p>Gibson have chosen an incredibly powerful, robust pair of ceramic humbucker pickups to give the Flying V some real clout. Burstbucker pickups are fitted in the neck and bridge positions. Ideal for hard, heavy rock but also versatile enough in many other musical genres, the Burstbucker 2 and 3 combo provide incredible power and tone.</p><p>Gibson have included two Volume controls plus a Master Tone knob joined by a 3-way toggle pickup switch for quick and easy manipulation of timbre.</p><h3>Hardware and finish</h3><p>For reliable, precise tuning, Gibson have employed Grover kidney-button tuners on the headstock. The tuners are constructed from a lightweight Zamak material and have a 14:01 gear ratio. A traditional chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge and an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece is fitted to the body ensuring enhanced sustain and resonance.</p><p>Stand-out visual appointments include the antique cherry finish in contrast with the protective 3-ply white pickguard, the silver Gibson logo on the arrowhead and black top hat control knobs with silver inserts. To keep the guitar in the best possible condition, Gibson include a Flying V hard shell case and an accessory kit so you can get set-up and playing immediately.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,560-560-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/ad600c4e30fba3dac613d9df67a6dfba.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson USA 2018 Flying V Electric Guitar - Antique Cherry","Gibson USA 2018 Flying V Electric Guitar - Antique Cherry",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Thanks to this open shape, you have complete access to all the frets the neck has to offer.

The tone you hear from the guitar is second to none. The updated 85/15 """"S"""" pickups produce sweet highs that chime so beautifully. The low and midrange notes are clear and defined, offering you an extensive range of tones to explore. The 85/15 """"S"""" dual humbuckers are often sought after and it's easy to see why, plus they only appear in core PRS guitars and cannot be sourced otherwise.</p><p>There is a 3-way pickup switch blade which allows you to easily flick between pickup combinations to suit your playing needs.

Alongside vintage-style features resides modern appointments that make this model a truly outstanding work of craftsmanship. It doesn't get much closer to the original than the 2018 Les Paul Traditional. Accompanying the guitar is a Gibson hardshell case and accessory kit.</p><h3> Late '50s Les Paul design </h3><p>To uphold the substantial feel of the late '50s Les Paul, Gibson have kept this as a non-weight relieved model. The result is a substantial yet manageable feel in the hands, with an unbeatable sustain and warmth. The same single-cutaway profile that we've all come to know and love is present and correct.</p><p>The classic tonewood partnership of mahogany body with maple top has been retained too. However, this isn't any old maple, it is grade AA figured maple. The result is a weighty midrange foundation with a clean upper mid to high frequency articulation that shines through. From smooth blues licks to searing high-gain soloing, the heart of the Les Paul produces resounding tones to suit any musical style. The finish has been treated to a slender yet durable layer of gloss nitrocellulose lacquer to protect against premature wear.</p><h3> Classic rounded neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid mahogany neck, which has been shaped to the rounded profile - again, ensuring a substantial yet manageable feel in the hand. Married to the neck is a sublime 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with acrylic trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. Rolled-over-fret cream binding creates seamless transitions between each fret to create the smoothest feel possible.</p><h3> Resilient, stage-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck you'll find the Tektoid nut, which works tirelessly to maintain string tension. The headstock is angled to Gibson's customary 17-degrees to improve tuning stability, whilst the Gibson logo is proudly on display for all to see. The nickel-plated vintage-style keystone tuning machines boast an impressive gear ratio, allowing them to firmly secure your strings during each and every performance. The body is home to the ABR bridge, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar tailpiece to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3>Sublime BurstBucker pickups</h3><p>The Gibson 2018 Les Paul Traditional is equipped with Burstbucker 1 and 2 humbuckers, fitted in the neck and bridge positions respectively. The Alnico II-powered Burstbuckers translate the richness of the body tonewoods, and the articulation of the neck and fingerboard construction with impeccable clarity.

As it has been since the beginning, Gibson has employed mahogany as the tonewood of choice, which establishes a rich midrange timbre that is delightfully smooth. Thanks to the powerful, yet articulate nature of mahogany, you are guaranteed an irrepressibly sweet output. The laid-back satin vintage sunburst finish creates a cool visual aesthetic, whilst the satin 50 sheen prevents unwanted stickiness from affecting playability during performances.</p><h3>Robust single-piece mahogany neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid mahogany neck, which lays the foundation for a resilient support that is a joy to glide along. Thanks to the slim taper neck profile, you'll never tire of running your hands along this beauty. Married to the neck is a responsive rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22-frets that are adorned with acrylic dot position inlays. The Tektoid nut at the top of the neck upholds string spacing and tension perfectly, which pairs with the 12-degree fingerboard radius brilliantly to guarantee smooth string bends and lightning fast licks, with all the sustain you could desire.</p><h3>Single-coil versatility</h3><p>The Gibson USA 2016 Les Paul Junior Single Coil adheres to its title, and is home to a pair of P-90 pickups that are each fitted in the neck and bridge positions. A P-90ST+ single-coil pickup with Alnico V magnet has been placed in the bridge position, which delivers a crunchy bite when given a bit of a push, whilst retaining an articulate character across each note. In the neck position, you'll find a P-90SR, which is slightly underwound to provide a more restrained - yet no less captivating - output than that of the bridge pickup. Paired together they offer the perfect middle ground, whilst each one can be used to their individual strengths to suit your playing demands and musical styles. Whether you're recording in the studio or performing to an adoring audience on the stage, the Les Paul Junior Single Coil is well equipped to tackle a wide range of musical styles.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The nickel-plated zamak tune-o-matic bridge and tailpiece work together to create a seamless connection between the strings and body to uphold intonation and sustain perfectly. The headstock is home to vintage-style tuning machines with white buttons, which dutifully maintain tuning integrity throughout the most enthusiastic of performances. You can happily rock out, safe in the knowledge that the hardware setup can keep up with anything you throw at it.</p><p>If you're looking for an electric guitar that is at home in studio as much as it is on the stage, then the Gibson USA 2016 Les Paul Junior Single Coil Limited Run Electric Guitar in Satin Vintage Sunburst is the one for you. Each model is supplied with a black gig bag, so no matter where your music takes you, you can take your pride and joy along too.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,530-530-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/474851392efaab4c63cda751bcee1f7e.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Les Paul Junior Single Coil Ltd Guitar - Satin Vintage Sunburst","Gibson Les Paul Junior Single Coil Ltd Guitar - Satin Vintage Sunburst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Taylor has applied their distinctive Venetian design to the classic design, giving it a smooth cutaway. Bob Taylor's favourite tonewood, solid Sitka spruce takes pride of place as the guitar's top. A seamless match for the dreadnought body shape, this wood provides brightness, clarity, and a broad dynamic range. It gets better with age as well; gaining individual characteristics the more it is played.</p><p>Solid sapele joins the spruce to make up the back and sides of the instrument. Similar to mahogany in its tonal offering, though with a little extra treble zing, this wood is a great all-rounder, with a balanced tone that suits any style of play.</p><p>A tropical mahogany neck topped by a 20-fret ebony fingerboard with large pearl dot inlays makes up the guitar's playing surface.</p><h3>Taylor Expression System (ES) Electronics</h3><p>Several years in the making, Taylor's Expression System is designed to naturally amplify the warm acoustic sound of the guitars it is fitted on. This it does by using an all-magnetic pickup system that functions like a microphone, giving the sound of the guitar, not the pickup. This part of the system is made up of two important elements: the Dynamic Body Sensor, which is mounted to the soundboard, and the Dynamic String Sensor, which is embedded beneath the fretboard, combined they capture the full sound of the guitar.</p>This is paired up with a discrete, unobtrusive preamp, outfitted with uncomplicated controls: Volume, Bass, and Treble. Created by Taylor, alongside the very guitars the Expression System would be used in, the point at which tradition meets technology is seamless, giving the Taylor 310ce Electro Acoustic Guitar a truer to acoustic, amplified sound.<p></p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1052-1052-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/860ff9a4b846f6d5cd2e8bfb8a328857.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 310ce Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 310ce Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

These dual coils allow the SR305E to produce an incredibly articulate universe of tones. </p> <p> The SR305E also features Ibanez Custom electronics with a 3-band EQ and 3-way Power Tap switch.

With an array of upgraded appointments, exquisite tonewoods and an incredibly durable construction, the SE Custom 24 will have you hooked.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>In keeping with tradition, the SE Custom 24 features the quintessential double body cutaway profile. Thanks to this open shape, you have complete access to all the frets the neck has to offer. The body top is constructed from maple and also has a maple veneer which adds to its appearance as well as protecting its colour finish. Mahogany is chosen to construct the back which works extremely well with the maple top for a top tonewood partnership.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>The 25 inch scale length SE Custom 24 is fitted with a smooth maple neck. The neck is shaped to a wide thin profile which is particularly suited to fast players and lead guitarists. The neck is then topped with a rosewood fingerboard which is home to 24 frets. The opulent bird inlays decorate the frets as a guide and can always be recognised as a PRS trademark.</p><h3>Upgraded Pickups</h3><p>The SE Custom 24 is fitted with a pair of upgraded humbucker pickups which have been specifically voiced by Paul Reed Smith to accurately mimic the sound of pickups found in core PRS models. The tone you hear from the guitar is second to none. The updated 85/15 """"S"""" pickups produce sweet highs that chime so beautifully. The low and midrange notes are clear and defined, offering you an extensive range of tones to explore. The 85/15 """"S"""" dual humbuckers are often sought after and it's easy to see why, plus they only appear in core PRS guitars and cannot be sourced otherwise.</p><p>There is a 3-way pickup switch blade which allows you to easily flick between pickup combinations to suit your playing needs. Simple controls for Volume and Tone facilitate sound tweaking whether you're recording or performing live.</p><h3>Hardware and Finish</h3><p>A PRS patented tremolo bridge is firmly fitted at the lower bout of the body and can execute pitch bends excellently. At the headstock, PRS SE tuners ensure that tuning accuracy is upheld with precision. The headstock also features an updated logo with Paul Reed Smith's signature above the """"SE"""". Nickel hardware adds a neat visual aesthetic to the maple veneer finish.</p><p>As with any PRS, the sheer quality of the design and build is outstanding. The guitar is ready to take out on the road from the moment you get it as you can rely on the PRS technicians to ensure that the guitar's setup is perfect from the beginning.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,PRS,TRUE,,,,,,,1003-1003-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/0f0d07ad66b13a60bbe5291dc297ede2.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"PRS 2017 SE Custom 24 Electric Guitar - Tobacco Sunburst","PRS 2017 SE Custom 24 Electric Guitar - Tobacco Sunburst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

There is a good chance that you're already familiar with the Jim Dandy Flat Top, but for the uninitiated, this model resurrects the style of Gretsch's """"Rex"""" parlor guitars of the 1930s, '40s and '50s """"Rex"""". On offer are select tonewoods that are married together beautifully, and 24-inch scale length neck for maximum comfort. The unique vintage white limited-edition model won't be around for long, so grab yours whilst you can.</p><h3> Diminutive parlor body shape </h3><p>Fans of Delta Blues, bluegrass and folk will fall for the timbre of the G9500, which delivers a satisfying twang with a bright upper mid-range emphasis. The parlor body shape may be small in stature, but it is no less impressive with its output. The G9500 responds with a rapid-fire attack and brilliant sounding high-end notes, so that fingerstyle performances can be plucked with confidence.</p><p> The body is crafted from agathis, which is a low-cost alternative to shares many of the same tonal qualities. X-bracing provides ample reinforcement for the soundboard without impeding its ability to resonate. The body has been finished in a limited edition vintage white, with an accompanying 1-ply tortoise pickguard decorated with a gold """"G"""" graphic.</p><h3> Generous neck length </h3><p>Though the body may be small, the neck offers a generous 24-inch scale length for you to comfortably explore.

Paired with the neck is an 18-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with pearloid dot position inlays to guide your way. The 12-inch fingerboard radius ensures that string bends are executed smoothly, and that your hand can roll across each string and all frets with ease.</p><h3> Reliable hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck you'll find a 1950's Gretsch 3-a-side headstock, sporting open-gear die-cast tuning machines that uphold tuning integrity with precision. The body is home to a rosewood bridge, which anchors each string securely to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><p>The Gretsch G9500 Limited Edition Jim Dandy Flat Top Acoustic Guitar in Vintage White is the perfect model for hitting the road with, thanks to its lightweight feel and manageable dimensions.

However, Gibson have raised the stakes by making this model exceptionally comfortable, and boasts a playing feel that will have you never wanting to put this beauty down.</p><h3>Sophisticated Les Paul design</h3><p>The heart and soul of the Les Paul tone comes from its tonewoods, and a long standing partnership of mahogany and maple. The body of the Gibson 2017 Les Paul Tribute T is built using a mahogany back, which creates a driving mid to low-end energy, which is tempered by a grade A plain maple top that ensures tonal clarity and articulation is exhibited in the upper mids to high end.</p><p>In order to make the model lightweight and more comfortable to perform with, Gibson have treated the body to a 9-hole weight relief system.

The partnership of tuners and Tektoid nut stabilises string tension to maintain the playing feel across each string throughout even the most energetic of performances. Fitted to the body is an aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with steel thumbwheels, as well as an aluminium stop bar tailpiece with steel posts. The bridge and tailpiece work together harmoniously to optimise intonation and sustain by creating a seamless connection between strings and body.</p><h3>Upgraded electronics</h3><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Tribute T is fitted with an impressive pickup pairing that includes a 490R in the neck position, and a 490T in the bridge position.

Tremonti has sold millions of albums all over and played in titan rock bands such as Creed and Alter Bridge. Now PRS have honoured him again in the form of a Custom Limited Run guitar.</p><h3>SE Tremonti Body</h3><p>Fans of both Tremonti and PRS know exactly what to expect in terms of the shape of the guitar's body. Featuring a single cutaway, the body provides you with full access to the higher registers of the neck.

To best transfer this sound, he has chosen Tremonti """"S"""" bass and treble humbucker pickups to amplify this Limited Edition model. Featured in the neck and bridge positions, these powerful humbuckers have been made to Tremonti's desired specifications to deliver great tone and sustain. Controls include an individual volume and tone control for each pickup, and a 3-way toggle pickup switch.</p><h3>PRS Hardware</h3><p>Despite the Tremonti Custom coming in at a fairly low and affordable price, the hardware is still superb quality. Fitted to the lower bout of the body is a PRS patented tremolo bridge which has a Trem-Up route, so you can bend the tremolo arm in various directions to perform bends and dive bombs. The headstock has the classic curved shape and is equipped with reliable nickel tuners.</p><p>As soon as you play the PRS SE 2017 Tremonti Custom Limited Run electric guitar, you will be astounded at its outstanding sound and quality appointments for such a low price.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,PRS,TRUE,,,,,,,999-999-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/413208e732810a3049eaa1de458e3ccd.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"PRS SE 2017 Tremonti Custom Limited Run Electric Guitar - Swamp Ash","PRS SE 2017 Tremonti Custom Limited Run Electric Guitar - Swamp Ash",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Accompanying the guitar is a Gibson hardshell case and accessory kit.</p><h3> Late '50s Les Paul design </h3><p>To uphold the substantial feel of the late '50s Les Paul, Gibson have kept this as a non-weight relieved model.

The same single-cutaway profile that we've all come to know and love is present and correct.</p><p>The classic tonewood partnership of mahogany body with maple top has been retained too. However, this isn't any old maple, it is grade AA figured maple. The result is a weighty midrange foundation with a clean upper mid to high frequency articulation that shines through. From smooth blues licks to searing high-gain soloing, the heart of the Les Paul produces resounding tones to suit any musical style. The finish has been treated to a slender yet durable layer of gloss nitrocellulose lacquer to protect against premature wear.</p><h3> Classic rounded neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid mahogany neck, which has been shaped to the rounded profile - again, ensuring a substantial yet manageable feel in the hand. Married to the neck is a sublime 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with acrylic trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. Rolled-over-fret cream binding creates seamless transitions between each fret to create the smoothest feel possible.</p><h3> Resilient, stage-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck you'll find the Tektoid nut, which works tirelessly to maintain string tension. The headstock is angled to Gibson's customary 17-degrees to improve tuning stability, whilst the Gibson logo is proudly on display for all to see. The nickel-plated vintage-style keystone tuning machines boast an impressive gear ratio, allowing them to firmly secure your strings during each and every performance. The body is home to the ABR bridge, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar tailpiece to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3>Sublime BurstBucker pickups</h3><p>The Gibson 2018 Les Paul Traditional is equipped with Burstbucker 1 and 2 humbuckers, fitted in the neck and bridge positions respectively.

The Gibson J-45 is often referred to as a """"workhorse"""" due to its balanced, wide-ranging tone and huge projection. This limited edition model features a blend of top quality tonewoods that contribute to the overall sound and beautiful appearance of the guitar.</p><h3>BODY</h3><p>This limited edition J-45 maintains that unmistakable body shape, and is constructed from very fine tonewoods. Sitka Spruce is used in the body top, offering plenty of volume in the guitar's voice. Traditional scalloped X-bracing further reinforces the body top, adding strength to the tonewood.</p><p>Gibson have upgraded the J-45 by employing English walnut in the body back and sides.

Dot inlays adorn the fretboard to guide you with confidence.</p><h3>ELECTRONICS</h3><p>The limited edition J-45 English Walnut Acoustic is equipped with the well-known LR Baggs VTC pickup system. This undersaddle pickup is subtle in appearance but not in sound. The sound projected by the LR Baggs VTC pickup can be easily adjusted using the removable volume and tone controls beneath the soundhole. This pickup system amplifies the J-45 wonderfully and with complete acoustic clarity through your desired amp or PA system.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The headstock of the J-45 is kitted out with gold open-back Grover tuners, which not only provide accurate tuning, but also add to the guitar's elegant appearance. The Tusq nut and saddle on the guitar also ensure that tuning remains in tact, so you can play on with ease.</p><p>The J-45 is fitted with a rigid rosewood bridge that holds a strong connection between the strings and body, thus providing a great level of sustain.

The familiar shape of this guitar makes it accessible to everyone, with a carefully selected combination of tonewoods that produces a truly unique timbre.</p><p>The body is crafted to the classic dreadnought-cutaway shape for easier access to the upper frets. This is a body profile designed to produce incredibly robust tones with a full-bodied response across the dynamic range. Whether you're a finger-picker or prefer to play with a plectrum; favour softly stroking the strings or attack them hard and fast, this body shape yields clearly defined notes every time.</p><p>The combination of tonewoods that have been used to craft the DCPA4 are solid sapele for the back and sides, with a solid Sitka spruce top. The sapele creates richly textured and complex tones with lots of emphasis on low-end to midrange power, generating a character that makes each model unique. The bright-sounding spruce top tempers the power produced by the sapele by infusing upper frequency clarity into the mix. It is also incredibly flexible, which allows it to project sound very efficiently.</p><p>Martin's hybrid """"X"""" scalloped bracing pattern allows the top to resonate fully whilst supporting it fully. You can rest assured that as with all guitars that Martin produce, the DCPA4 is a workhorse that is most definitely built to last. The repeated playing of this guitar - in every environment you can think of - will enable it to develop a character that is completely unique to that of any other model.</p><p>An exquisitely detailed Delmar tortoiseshell colour pickguard protects the underside of the strings. The edging around the top is protected by black boltaron binding to ensure no unwanted nicks or chips affect the soundboard's ability to perform.</p><p>The select hardwood neck is combined with a black richlite fingerboard, working together to create a crisp and articulate counterpoint to the powerful body shape and tonewoods. No matter how hard you may strike the strings, you will only ever get a joyful tone of the utmost definition. Offset white ABS dots guide your way up the fingerboard as you play.</p><p>To make the DCPA4 truly versatile, Martin have installed the Fishman F1 analog electronics system, allowing you to take you sound to the next level and play to a much larger audience. The Fishman F1 perfectly represents the tonal output of the DCPA4 without distortion of the signal, simply amplifying it. This is exemplified by the simplistic control setup of a single volume control and a single tone control. Simply plug in using the 1/4"""" jack and you're good to go. A built-in digital chromatic tuner makes it quick and easy for you to check your tuning after each song. The useful low battery indicator will guarantee that you know exactly when to change it so you'll never need to have that mid gig panic of suddenly dropping out of the mix.</p><p>The Martin DCPA4 is a beautiful electro acoustic, completed in a shaded natural finish that is perfect for guitarists/singer-songwriters who're looking for a guitar that offers loads of midrange power with detailed precision. It comes with a 345 hardshell case so you're ready to gig as soon as it arrives.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Martin Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,938-938-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/a401684503e80f048cfb2370444cf918.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Martin DCPA4 Electro Acoustic Guitar - Shaded Natural","Martin DCPA4 Electro Acoustic Guitar - Shaded Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Wearing its heritage proudly, the classic adornments we've come to expect from a Les Paul are on offer with a cool single-cutaway profile, luxurious tonewoods, peerless tonal control and resilient hardware. However, Gibson have raised the stakes by making this model exceptionally comfortable, and boasts a playing feel that will have you never wanting to put this beauty down.</p><h3>Sophisticated Les Paul design</h3><p>The heart and soul of the Les Paul tone comes from its tonewoods, and a long standing partnership of mahogany and maple. The body of the Gibson 2017 Les Paul Tribute T is built using a mahogany back, which creates a driving mid to low-end energy, which is tempered by a grade A plain maple top that ensures tonal clarity and articulation is exhibited in the upper mids to high end.</p><p>In order to make the model lightweight and more comfortable to perform with, Gibson have treated the body to a 9-hole weight relief system. The powerful timbre of the guitar is not compromised in any way, which makes this a dream model for those who are seeking a Les Paul that is more forgiving when played over long periods of time.</p><h3> Sturdy and responsive neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid mahogany neck, which has been treated to a slim taper profile to lend its support in creating a delightful playing feel. Married to the neck is a sublime rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with trapezoid position inlays to guide your way in style. The single-cutaway body profile allows you to reach the upper frets with ease, giving you complete freedom to explore the neck in its entirety.</p><p>At the top of the neck you'll find the headstock, which is equipped with vintage-style keystone tuners to uphold tuning integrity with precision. The partnership of tuners and Tektoid nut stabilises string tension to maintain the playing feel across each string throughout even the most energetic of performances. Fitted to the body is an aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with steel thumbwheels, as well as an aluminium stop bar tailpiece with steel posts. The bridge and tailpiece work together harmoniously to optimise intonation and sustain by creating a seamless connection between strings and body.</p><h3>Upgraded electronics</h3><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Tribute T is fitted with an impressive pickup pairing that includes a 490R in the neck position, and a 490T in the bridge position. Control over the pickups comes via independent volume and tone pots for each pickup, as well as a three-way selector switch. To complement the luxurious overall finish, gold """"Top Hat"""" knobs have been employed. The range of tonal colours you have to paint with is astonishing, with murky muddy, fat saturated lows to impeccably polished highs that sing. Whatever style of music you are tackling, the Les Paul Faded T is more than capable of exceeding your expectations.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>To complete the package, the Gibson 2017 Les Paul Tribute T is supplied with a padded gig bag to protect your new pride and joy, as well as get you out on the road asap.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,471-471-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/7d59e5039e1f5e3be211cc89101f0ae2.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 Les Paul Tribute T Electric Guitar - Satin Gold Top","Gibson 2017 Les Paul Tribute T Electric Guitar - Satin Gold Top",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Crafted with a Sitka spruce top and sapele back and sides, and utilising the ES-T under-saddle transducer pickup system, this is an exceptional entry-level guitar that's perfect for performers.</p><p>The Grand Auditorium shape of the Taylor 114e gives it the following dimension: Body Length: 20"""", Body Width: 16"""", Body Depth: 4 5/8"""", meaning, in size terms, that it sits between a Dreadnought and Grand Concert. This is no accident, as it picks up the best properties of both shapes, to provide an exceptionally versatile guitar.</p><p>With a size that is larger than Grand Concert, it can handle medium-strength picking and strumming, yet being smaller than a dreadnought it is also ideal for finger-style, all whilst providing a balanced, clear tone, with an emphasised midrange. The summation here being that it is excellent for sing-songwriters who need to compose on the go; luckily it also comes supplied with a gigbag.</p><p>The Sitka spruce top of the guitar gives clarity and crisp definition across a broad dynamic range, no matter how you play. This wood type doesn't end there though, as you will find it growing subtle tonal characteristics as the guitar ages and the more it is played, becoming as individual as your own playing.</p><p>The guitar's back and sides are made up of a core of poplar sandwiched between layers of sapele. This technique of layering woods equips the instrument with additional resilience to changes in humidity, whilst remaining in-keeping with the rest of the guitar's design and sound and keeping costs down. The back has also been pressed into a slight arch, which makes it more comfortable to hold, stronger, and provides a rich, fuller tone.</p><p>The slightly narrower, 1 11/16-inch sapele neck, is exceptionally playable and is topped by a 20-fret, ebony fingerboard with 6mm dot inlays.</p><p>When it comes to plugging into an amplifier or P.A system, the Taylor 114e Grand Auditorium Electro Acoustic Guitar keep things uncomplicated with the specially-voiced, ES-T under-saddle transducer pickup system, which includes a Phase switch for feedback control (located on the preamp board inside the soundhole).</p><p>This is teamed up with a discreet preamp that offers three controls: a custom-voiced EQ (comprised of bass and treble) and a volume control, with a low-battery LED indicator also built-in.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1024-1024-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/31a6f649cdc5f803bc590865435448c2.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 114e Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 114e Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The guitar's unique design means that it is perfect for those who want a no-nonsense model that is perfect for high gain musical styles, and compact in size to make it exceptionally comfortable to play. As you'd expect from the team at Gretsch, this is a workhorse that is perfect for beginners and gigging pros alike.</p><h3> Sleek Body Profile </h3><p>The body is crafted using laminated maple, a highly resonant tonewood that produces a brilliant high-end energy. The laminate also gives the wood greater resilience with regard to changes in temperature and humidity, making the G2655T a fantastic model for touring with. A lightweight spruce centre block runs along the length of the body internally, which helps to reinforce the body top, whilst suppressing unwanted feedback when you're performing high-gain musical styles. The vintage aesthetic of the G2655T Streamliner is reinforced by the elegant two-ply white and black body binding to emphasise the sultry curves of this model. Further protection is afforded to the finish thanks to a layer of gloss.</p><h3> Sturdy and Responsive Nato Neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a reassuringly solid nato neck, which is shaped with a thin """"U"""" profile for increased playing comfort. Paired with the neck is a 22 medium fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with pearloid block inlays to guide your way in style. The fingerboard is shaped with 12-inch radius, guaranteeing that string bends are executed smoothly, whilst your fingers are given a luxurious playground to explore. The double-cutaway body profile enables greater access to the upper frets, giving you total command of the neck and fingerboard.</p><h3> Versatile Broad'Tron Humbuckers </h3><p>The energy produced in the body is harnessed and translated beautifully by the Broad'Tron humbucking pickups. This high-output partnership delivers lows with a thunderous roar, mids with a weighty punch, and highs with a ringing clarity. Whatever style of music you play; the Streamliner is as adaptable as your playing style demands.</p><p>Control comes in the form of independent volume controls for each pickup, a master volume pot, and a master tone pot. There is a three-way pickup selector switch that allows you to select either pickup individually, or both simultaneously. In keeping with the vintage finishing touches, black vintage-style control knobs are on hand for smooth and precise control over your tone.</p><h3> Heavenly Vibrato Control </h3><p>The exceptional playability and control afforded by the G2655T wouldn't be quite the same without the anchored adjusto-matic bridge and Bigsby-Licensed B50 tailpiece partnership. String action adjustment is simple thanks to the bridge, and you can rest assured that tuning stability, intonation and sustain is upheld dutifully thanks the combined effort of the bridge and synthetic bone nut. The Bigsby-Licensed B50 tailpiece is a joy to work with, responding gracefully and returning to its original position quickly.</p><p>The headstock - along with the single-ply black pickguard - proudly bears the gold Gretsch logo, whilst die-cast nickel tuning machines uphold tuning integrity with unwavering accuracy during the most energetic of performances.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gretsch Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,612-612-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/93d620b68bb0fe0d2ec7c8546971251d.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"G2655T Streamliner Bigsby Electric Guitar","G2655T Streamliner Bigsby Electric Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The harmonious marriage of an exquisitely comfortable playability and exceptional tonal versatility serves to make this bass a truly remarkable model. </p> <h3> Construction </h3> <p> In keeping with the slender, sleek and effortlessly playable feel, the body of the Ibanez GSR200B-WNF bass features an ergonomically shaped profile that enables the instrument to rest snugly against you during performances. Mahogany has been used in the construction of the body due to its rich, dense timbre, which gives the bass a thumping, driven tonality. Fitted to the body is a stable B10 bridge, anchoring each string to guarantee optimum intonation and sustain. </p> <p> The GSR200B-WNF benefits from Ibanez' wealth of experience in forming necks that are renowned for being super-slim, fast-playing and a joy to run your hand along, whilst retaining an enviable strength that is very reassuring. The maple neck adds the perfect counter to the mahogany's low-end drive, by delivering an articulate measure. Married to the neck is a 22-fret rosewood fingerboard that is decorated with white dot position inlays to guide your way. </p> <h3> Electronics </h3> <p> Representing the timbre of the mahogany/maple/rosewood partnership is no mean feat, but Ibanez has carried it off with ease. The GSR200B-WNF is equipped with a pair of Ibanez Dynamix pickups, which are fitted in the neck and bridge positions. This pairing guarantees a smooth and responsive sonic representation of the tonewoods, from warm mid to low tones through to crisp upper mid to high tones. By including the Phat II EQ system, Ibanez has ensured that an active bass boost is present to give even greater energy to your low-end drive. </p> <p> The Ibanez GSR200B-WNF bass guitar carries and affordable price tag that makes it fantastic for beginners, but more experienced players will recognise many standard Ibanez traits in this design: impeccable construction, fantastic tonewoods, diverse tonality, intuitive controls, joyful playability, and with the Walnut Flat finish to seal the deal, this is a bass not to be missed. </p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Ibanez Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,764-764-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/f3c7514a46cc9dd59994895f1bb89342.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Ibanez GSR200B-WNF Bass Guitar - Walnut Flat","Ibanez GSR200B-WNF Bass Guitar - Walnut Flat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Unlike a conventional 6-string acoustic which would usually be tuned from E to E, the Baritone-6 is a non-cutaway baritone dreadnought which is tuned from B to B and yet still retains a normal string tension even for a lower register. Built using superb quality tonewoods and equipped with robust, dedicated hardware, the 410e is an acoustic like no other which will form a beautiful partnership with a wide range of varied instruments.</p><h3>Non-Cutaway Dreadnought</h3><p>The LTD 410e has a classic dreadnought body profile with no cutaway needed, offering a slick visual appearance, while the baritone bracing adds stability beneath the soundboard. The Baritone-6 LTD has a 27 inch scale length and uses ovangkol to structure the back and sides. Ovangkol is a sustainable material which comes from the African rosewood family, giving the 410e a well-rounded and well-balanced overall tone suitable for all musical styles. An Engelmann spruce top in a Tobacco Sunburst finish completes the body. Engelmann spruce wood is known for its rich midrange and a tone which sounds like it has perhaps come from an older model for a mature acoustic the moment you take it out of the box.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>A mahogany neck with a comfortable profile is fitted to the 410e for optimal playability. Despite the baritone nature of this model, the string tension is normal, like any other high-quality acoustic, making it feel easy to play. The neck is topped with an ebony fingerboard for a sumptuous surface beneath the fingertips. The frets feature decorative Italian acrylic 4mm dot inlays which guide you throughout each movement. Enjoy the lower register of tone on offer with this 19-fret model.</p><h3>Expression System 2 Pickup</h3><p>The natural baritone voice of the 410e can be eloquently transferred via a PA system or amplifier thanks to the Expression System 2 pickup. The ES2 pickup has a unique design which involves three individually calibrated pickup sensors that are positioned to improve the amplified tone of the guitar it sits within. The lower registers and the rich, cultured acoustic sounds of this Limited Edition model sound just as wonderful when amplified.</p><h3>Hardware and Finish</h3><p>The 410e Baritone-6 comes in a warm Tobacco Sunburst finish which is complemented by the shading of the back and sides, white binding and purfling. A 3-ring soundhole rosette is also partnered by a tortoise pickguard to protect against scratches. An ebony bridge improves the sustain and sonic texture on offer from the 410e Baritone-6 LTD model.</p><p>The Baritone-6 headstock is fitted with robust Taylor nickel tuners that ensure the B-tuning of the guitar remains firmly in place. To protect your new baritone beauty, Taylor include a deluxe hardshell case, plus it comes with a Limited Edition label.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1070-1070-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/74636e16ba34b66825833c2623b27afe.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 410e Baritone-6 LTD Electro Acoustic Guitar - Tobacco Sunburst","Taylor 410e Baritone-6 LTD Electro Acoustic Guitar - Tobacco Sunburst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Wearing its heritage proudly, the classic adornments we've come to expect from a Les Paul are on offer with a cool single-cutaway profile, luxurious tonewoods, peerless tonal control and resilient hardware. However, Gibson have raised the stakes by making this model exceptionally comfortable, and boasts a playing feel that will have you never wanting to put this beauty down.</p><h3>Sophisticated Les Paul design</h3><p>The heart and soul of the Les Paul tone comes from its tonewoods, and a long standing partnership of mahogany and maple. The body of the Gibson 2017 Les Paul Tribute T is built using a mahogany back, which creates a driving mid to low-end energy, which is tempered by a grade A plain maple top that ensures tonal clarity and articulation is exhibited in the upper mids to high end.</p><p>In order to make the model lightweight and more comfortable to perform with, Gibson have treated the body to a 9-hole weight relief system. The powerful timbre of the guitar is not compromised in any way, which makes this a dream model for those who are seeking a Les Paul that is more forgiving when played over long periods of time.</p><h3> Sturdy and responsive neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid mahogany neck, which has been treated to a slim taper profile to lend its support in creating a delightful playing feel. Married to the neck is a sublime rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with trapezoid position inlays to guide your way in style. The single-cutaway body profile allows you to reach the upper frets with ease, giving you complete freedom to explore the neck in its entirety.</p><p>At the top of the neck you'll find the headstock, which is equipped with vintage-style keystone tuners to uphold tuning integrity with precision. The partnership of tuners and Tektoid nut stabilises string tension to maintain the playing feel across each string throughout even the most energetic of performances. Fitted to the body is an aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with steel thumbwheels, as well as an aluminium stop bar tailpiece with steel posts. The bridge and tailpiece work together harmoniously to optimise intonation and sustain by creating a seamless connection between strings and body.</p><h3>Upgraded electronics</h3><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Tribute T is fitted with an impressive pickup pairing that includes a 490R in the neck position, and a 490T in the bridge position. Control over the pickups comes via independent volume and tone pots for each pickup, as well as a three-way selector switch. To complement the luxurious overall finish, gold """"Top Hat"""" knobs have been employed. The range of tonal colours you have to paint with is astonishing, with murky muddy, fat saturated lows to impeccably polished highs that sing. Whatever style of music you are tackling, the Les Paul Faded T is more than capable of exceeding your expectations.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>To complete the package, the Gibson 2017 Les Paul Tribute T is supplied with a padded gig bag to protect your new pride and joy, as well as get you out on the road asap.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,469-469-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/c649027112f131953f038fba5f7cdbf3.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 Les Paul Tribute T Electric Guitar - Faded Honey Burst","Gibson 2017 Les Paul Tribute T Electric Guitar - Faded Honey Burst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The solid sitka spruce top is secured using the incredibly strong standard """"X"""" bracing pattern, keeping the spruce stable whilst allowing the top to vibrate naturally. Due to its wonderfully resonant properties, the sitka spruce makes an excellent soundboard and projects sound in a consistent and articulate manner.</p><p>The back and sides of the 000-28 are made from solid East Indian rosewood, held in high renown due to its high velocity of sound. This means - in much the same way as the sitka spruce - it projects sound robustly and consistently. The combination of these tonewoods gives the 000-28 a fantastic ability to project sound with little to no effort at all, vastly increasing the dynamic range of the instrument - perfect for guitarist who require a guitar that can articulate the nuances of their playing most accurately.</p><p>To ensure the body is protected from unwanted damage, the edges are bound in white boltaron. A layer of polished gloss protects the entire body from unwanted marks, rubbing or scratches without impeding the tonewood's vibrations.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>Only select hardwood is used to build the neck, in order to create a solid channel for the strings to resonate. A solid black ebony fingerboard rests atop the neck, playing home to 20 desirable frets. The neck shape is cut to a low profile and the fingerboard radius is a mere 1-11/16"""" at the nut to 2-1/8"""" at the 12th fret. This means that for those with smaller hands or seek a narrower playing surface without losing out to a less powerful body, can have the best of both worlds.</p><h3>Finish</h3><p>Chrome enclosed tuning machines ensure that each string's tuning integrity is maintained throughout each performance. The belly style solid black ebony bridge ensures the string's connection to the body remains true, giving you utter confidence in the 000-28's ability to perform.</p><p>The body is protected beneath the soundhole by a decorative and functional black pickguard, reducing the chances of nicking or scraping the sitka spruce whilst playing.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Martin Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,936-936-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/cb7a3b673bdf58e50c335848703be95d.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Martin 000-28 Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Martin 000-28 Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Through a combination of vintage-style and updated technology, Gibson has captured the vibrant energy and character of a classic Les Paul, whilst exceeding the tonal demands of today's guitarists.</p><h3>Sleek Les Paul design</h3><p>As you'd expect, the body is crafted using classic combination of two-piece mahogany that has been combined with a grade A plain maple top. The mahogany has been treated to a 9-hole weight relief rout, which makes the body lighter and easier to wield, without losing any of that raw Les Paul power. The maple doesn't just look pretty either; it lends itself to a sweetly delivered high-end that allows this beauty to truly sparkle. The body protected by a smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer, which preserves that natural grain and paintwork to allow your Les Paul to age gracefully.</p><h3>Single-piece mahogany neck</h3><p>To create a confident playing feel, Gibson have fitted a single-piece mahogany neck using a solid mortise and tenon joint reinforced using Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive. You can rest assured that no matter how hard you play, the neck is built with durability at its heart. Thanks to its slimtaper profile, the neck is delightfully slender and accommodating most player's hands with ease.</p><p>Married to the neck is a heavenly rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. Cream binding along the fingerboard ensures seamless transitions between frets, whilst the standard 12-inch radius makes it a breeze to perform smooth string bends.</p><h3>Zebra '57 Classic humbuckers</h3><p>To create a tonal match for the sophisticated '60s/'70s aesthetic, the Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar is equipped with a Zebra '57 Classic in the neck position, and a Zebra '57 Classic Plus in the bridge. The depth and warmth of the mahogany is given the commanding presence it deserves, with a hearty mid to low-end energy flowing from the pickups, thanks to the wound Alnico II magnet-driven humbuckers. The crispness of the maple rings truly, offering a snappy counterpoint to the dense mahogany.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes via the pickup independent volume and tone controls, which allow you to sculpt and shape your tone with precision. Orange Drop capacitors ensure that the slightest of adjustments is executed as smoothly as possible, putting absolute tone control in your hands.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>The headstock is home to Grover's zamak locking tuners with an impressive 14:01 tuning ratio, so you can rest assured that no slipping will occur during any emphatic string bending. The strings meet the body via the nickel-plated zamak ABR bridge and nickel-plated aluminium stop bar tailpiece. From the tuning machines down to the tailpiece, everything is designed and fitted to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>Each Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar model is supplied with a classic Gibson hardshell case in brown to protect your pride and joy whether it is in storage or in transit. With the 2017 model you will also receive a Gibson USA multi tool, premium strap, polishing cloth, and owner's manual to help you to keep your Les Paul in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,459-459-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/1ef23b25726f3bd285bfea0bdca27ab9.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar","Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Electric Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

This equates to a powerful but balanced instrument, performing with articulation across the entire tonal spectrum. Flatpickers and strummers have the most to gain with this guitar but with its versatility, finger-style players could well find a home here, too.

The neck and fingerboard tonal characteristics balance out the overall tone of the bass by giving the mid to treble range more depth, as well as a fast attack when executing slap or picking techniques. </p> <h3>Versatile electronics</h3> <p> The SR300EB is fitted with the powerful active PowerSpan Dual Coil neck pickups in the neck and bridge positions. The enhanced Style Sweeper EQ section - with specific Bass, Mid and Treble EQ controls - gives you enormous control over the pickups, allowing you to craft your sound so that you can dip in and out of any musical style/genre you desire.

Baggs Element VTC pickup translates rich acoustic timbre</li><li>Includes Gibson standard hardshell case and accessory kit</li></ul><p>The Gibson Acoustic 2018 J-45 Standard Guitar in Vintage Sunburst is a shining example of their best-selling acoustic of all time. The iconic round-shoulder dreadnought has been a favourite of guitarists since its introduction in 1942, earning the worthy nickname """"The Workhorse"""" due to its faithful resilience throughout thick and thin. If it's longevity that you're after, then the J-45 should be your priority.</p><h3>Classic tonewoods</h3><p>Gibson's Acoustic team know a thing or two when it comes to building fine acoustic guitars, and the 2018 J-45 benefits from expertise gained through decades of painstaking dedication. The body top is built using solid Sitka spruce, a tonewood that is favoured as a soundboard thanks to its highly resonant nature, which projects tones with absolute clarity. Not only that, but the more that you play this beauty, the more its character develops to create a timbre that is truly unique. The top is reinforced using traditional hand-scalloped X-bracing, which prevents buckling of the top whilst enabling it to resonate unimpeded.</p><p>For the back and sides of the body, Gibson have selected another favourite with mahogany. Known for generating a smooth warmth, mahogany establishes a weight mid to low-end character that sings beautifully. The result is a potent mix of power and poise with a nuanced frequency response that sits perfectly in an ensemble, but can more than assuredly hold its own for solo performers.</p><h3>Sturdy neck design</h3><p>Married to the body via a compound dovetail joint is a solid mahogany neck, which has been treated to the slimtaper profile for a faster playing feel. Married to the neck is a heavenly rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 20 frets that are adorned with mother of pearl dot position inlays to guide your way in style. The fingerboard is polished with finishing oil to enhance the natural compounds of the wood, thus giving it a lasting feel of elegance.</p><h3>Gig-ready appointments</h3><p>The headstock is home to Grover Rotomatic tuners, which uphold tuning integrity with precision. The body is home to a traditional belly up rosewood bridge, which creates a seamless connection between the strings and body for optimised intonation and sustain. The result is a guitar that performs with consistency every time you pick up and play. Whether you're recording in the studio or taking to the stage, knowing that you can rely on your instrument is of the utmost importance. You can put all your trust in the J-45.</p><h3> L.R. Baggs Element VTC Pickup System </h3><p>Equipped with the award-winning L.R. Baggs Element VTC electronics' system, you can take to the stage in effortless style and plug directly into the amp or P.A. of your choosing, safe in the knowledge that the acoustic character of your guitar will be translated transparently.</p><p>The pre-attached Element pickup, and all-discrete endpin preamp are controlled using the soundhole-mounted volume and tone controls. The built-in low frequency crossover prevents any unwanted low-end grunt from over-powering your signal, and allows the natural timbre of the J-45 to sing with the utmost clarity.</p><p>The Gibson Acoustic 2018 J-45 Standard Guitar in Vintage Sunburst is supplied with a Gibson hardshell case, as well as a Gibson accessory kit. Wherever your music takes you, you can get your guitar there in security and style, and keep it in top condition for years to come.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,503-503-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/d23df37b30c41f433256e2673dd64677.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Acoustic 2018 J-45 Standard Guitar - Vintage Sunburst","Gibson Acoustic 2018 J-45 Standard Guitar - Vintage Sunburst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Once you pick up and play one of these beauties, you'll immediately appreciate and understand why so many guitarists have turned to the SJ-200 as their preferred instrument of choice. From rock to country, no genre remains untouched by this majestic acoustic's influence.</p><h3>Solid Super Jumbo</h3><p>The Gibson Acoustic 2018 SJ-200 is bestowed with the classic Super Jumbo body profile, which gives it large dimensions that results in a huge output that offers a wide dynamic range. The delivery may be substantial, but thanks to the elegantly executed constructed and carefully selected tonewoods, the SJ-200 sings with a delightfully nuanced timbre. Whether you're playing as part of an ensemble or going solo, the Super Jumbo shape gives you the versatility to play within or above a mix with ease.</p><h3>Tasteful tonewoods</h3><p>The body back and sides are built using maple, which establishes a bright and punchy tonal foundation. Paired with the maple is a Sitka spruce top, which is reinforced using traditional hand-scalloped X-bracing to optimise projection and resonance whilst preventing unwanted buckling and warping over time.</p><p>As well as the awesome Vintage Sunburst finish, additional touches have been applied to make this beauty stand head and shoulders above the rest. Multi-ply binding to the top and bottom complements the tonewood finish exquisitely, the multi-ply double-ring rosette encircles the soundhole, and a subtle coating of nitrocellulose lacquer protects the finish. The icing on the cake comes in the form of an ornately decorated traditional cast SJ-200 pickguard.</p><h3>Sturdy yet supple maple neck</h3><p>Using a compound dovetail neck-to-body joint for strength, the 2018 SJ-200 Standard has been given a strong and reliable maple neck. Shaped to a round profile to guarantee comfort and stability, the neck ensures a substantial yet manageable feel in the hand. Married to the neck is a luxurious rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 20 frets that are adorned with hand mother-of-pearl crown inlays. Whether you're fretting chords, strumming your heart out, or playing intricate fingerstyle, the neck and fingerboard accommodate all styles equally.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The Gibson SJ-200 headstock is home to a set of gold Grover Rotomatic tuning machines, which uphold tuning integrity with precision. Between the headstock and neck rests the Tusq nut, which carries out the task of maintaining string tension dutifully. The delightfully designed SJ-200 moustache bridge creates a seamless connection between the strings and body, ensuring optimum intonation throughout each performance.</p><h3>LR Baggs Anthem</h3><p>The SJ-200 Standard is equipped with an upgraded, award-winning L.R. Baggs Anthem pickup system.

Don't be fooled by the smaller dimensions though, as this shape can easily project a big sound. The balance of treble and bass makes it excellent for those looking for an ideal fingerstyle guitar.</p><p>The 000RSGT body is crafted using solid sapele for the back and sides, partnered up with a solid Sitka spruce top.

Black boltoran binding ensures the edging between the top and sides is guarded against accidental knocks and lends itself to the slick aesthetic.</p><p>The solid sipo neck and black richlite fingerboard create the perfect partnership alongside the body. Each note is articulated with exquisite detail so that every inflection or bit of your playing technique is represented exactly how you expect it to be. The neck has a layer of protection thanks to a gentle satin coating to allow a fast-playing feel, allowing you to move up and down it smoothly.</p><p>Fitted to the 000RSGT is a Fishman Sonitone USB electronic system. If you wish to play to a larger audience, simply plug in your guitar and you're ready to go. The USB output allows you to easily connect the guitar directly to your chosen interface, straight into your DAW of choice and record cleanly and easily. The guys at Martin have clearly thought of everything!</p><p>The black richlite bridge guarantees a seamless connection between your strings and the body - adding to the excellent sustain properties. Chrome enclosed tuning machines with small buttons carry out the task of maintaining tuning integrity with absolute precision, allow you to play exactly how you want to with total reassurance.</p><p>The Martin 000RSGT is the total package for recording artists and touring musicians looking for an instrument they can use in the studio, take on the road and practise with to their heart's content.

The result of years of R&amp;D is the Expression System, which is now in its second version.</p><p>With the Expression System 2 installed in the Taylor 324e-SEB Special Edition Guitar, you get an extremely accurate image of your guitar's tone, captured by three strategically-positioned sensors found behind the saddle.

With the G5655T electric guitar, Gretsch extend their reach further into the hard rock market with a versatile beauty, capable of producing wonderfully lush tones with explosive power.</p><h3> Body </h3><p>The arched top, back and sides of the G5655T are crafted from solid 5-ply maple, a beautiful tonewood that yields bright, precise tones, with lots of high-end sparkle and tempered lows. Within the body runs a solid piece of spruce that carries out the job of preventing unwanted feedback from the highly resonant maple body. Therefore, those who're in the pursuit of high-gain can ramp it up, without incurring the wrath of noise colouration from the reverberant tonewood.</p><p>The finish is protected by a light coating of incredibly resilient gloss urethane coating, strong enough to protect the paint work, thin enough to allow the tonewood to resonate without impedance. The body and fingerboard are bound in white to protect them from nicks and complete the body's cool aesthetic.</p><h3> Neck </h3><p>The maple neck and rosewood fingerboard, soften the upper and lower frequency ranges leaving a lovely, rounded signal. They also emphasise the mids to give the G5655T a full-bodied tone with thundering lows, punchy mids and snappy highs when played hard. Played gently, each note rings out with perfect clarity like all good Gretschs do, giving you total confidence in this guitar's ability to shine, no matter what style you wish to play.</p><p>The fingerboard is cut to a very comfortable 12.5"""" radius that is absolutely perfect for string bending without the unwanted fret buzz or dead notes. The 21 medium-jumbo frets invite you to play as you're guided by the classic white pearloid neo-classic """"Thumbnail"""" position inlays. The neck also has a thin coating of gloss urethane, leaving it smooth and fast for rapid movement up and down the fingerboard.</p><h3> Electronics </h3><p>The G5655T features a Black Top Filter'Tron pickup in the bridge position and a dual-coil SUPER HiLo'Tron pickup in the neck position. The Black Top mini-humbucker in the bridge excels in driving mid to low end tones with plenty of bite. The dual-coil Super HiLo'Tron represents the upper mid to high frequency output perfectly by offering up sweet, shimmering highs.</p><h3> Hardware </h3><p>The anchored adjusto-matic bridge ensures the strings' connection to the body is guaranteed throughout each and every performance giving you complete reassurance whilst you play. The much loved Bigsby-license B50 vibrato tailpiece allows you to add your own unique nuances to anything you play. Tuning integrity is maintained thanks to the excellent Grover die cast tuners across the headstock so no matter how many times to bend or dive, this guitar can match you every step of the way.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gretsch Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,638-638-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/cbd755f64408533766add69ff79c0789.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"G5655T-CB Electric Guitar - Rosa Red","G5655T-CB Electric Guitar - Rosa Red",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Everything from the construction of the tonewoods to the most minute of finishing touches, has been pored over with due care and attention by the team at Gibson. The result is an outstanding model that deserves to be treasured, and is the perfect partner for taking centre stage with.</p><h3> Classic Les Paul design </h3><p>As the name suggests, Gibson has aimed to adhere as closely as possible to the Les Paul body feel that has made it the go-to guitar for so many over several decades. Therefore, the body has not been treated to any weight relief, and instead bears the weightier feel of older Les Paul models. Combined with the single-cutaway body profile, the Les Paul Traditional HP certainly lives up to its name, generating a hearty sustain and powerful timbre.</p><p>The body is crafted using mahogany, which is paired with a AAA grade flamed maple top, which is protected by a smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer. The combination of mahogany and maple creates a confident mix of mid to low-end energy with crisp and articulate highs. Cream binding has been applied around the body top to accentuate the rich finish of the top.</p><h3> Classic rounded neck with Fast-Access heel </h3><p>Fitted to the body via a classic mortis and tenon joint is the single-piece mahogany neck. Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive has been tasked with reinforcing the neck joint to maximise stability and strength. In keeping with the traditional approach, the neck has been shaped to the rounded profile, which gives the neck a more substantial feel in the hand. A new addition to the Les Paul HP is the fast-access heel on the back of the guitar, which creates a slimmer body depth for improved access to the upper frets.</p><p>Married to the neck is a sublime 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with trapezoid Mother-of-Pearl inlays to guide your way in style. The fingerboard has been increased in thickness, which makes it ideal for those who like to flex their playing muscles. Cream binding traces along the edge of the fingerboard to create seamless transitions between frets.</p><h3>Improved G-FORCE tuning system</h3><p>Gibson's G-FORCE auto-tuning system has also been given an upgrade, so that fast, accurate string tuning is now even easier than ever before. Whether you're playing in standard, using an alternate tuning, or making up your own that you can save and recall at a later time, you'll be amazed at how smoothly the G-FORCE system operates - and also at how quietly the synchronized spur gear system operates too.</p><h3> Resilient, stage-ready hardware </h3><p>The titanium zero-fret adjustable nut guarantees exceptional tone, sustain and durability. Total action control means that the playing feel will remain uniform no matter how much you rock out, and the useful locking feature prevents unwanted alteration. The Gibson logo adorns the top of the headstock, with a gold """"Les Paul Model"""" silkscreen resting between the tuning pegs. Angled to Gibson's customary 17-degrees to improve tuning stability and string tension, the Les Paul Standard HP is built to endure anything you can throw at it.</p><p>The body is home to the aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with titanium saddles and locking thumbwheels, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar with locking studs. The bridge and tailpiece partnership works dutifully to ensure intonation and sustain is optimised so that your Les Paul sings beautifully, and with the richness it deserves.</p><h3>Burstbucker 2 and 3+ humbucker pickups</h3><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional HP Electric Guitar has been fitted with a Burstbucker 2 and 3+ humbuckers, fitted in the neck and bridge positions respectively. The Alnico II-powered Burstbuckers translate the richness of the body tonewoods, and the articulation of the neck and fingerboard construction with impeccable clarity. They produce the same glorious Gibson tones we all know and love, with a little added bite compared to their model T counterparts.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of new push-pull knurled knobs, which are finished in chrome to accentuate the stunning body finish. The switchable functions on offer are: to Tap or Split either pickup; activate an integrated High Pass Filter; or introduce transient suppression. The range of tones on offer is truly staggering, and you'll wonder how you ever got by without this guitar in your arsenal during any studio session or tour.Included Accessories</p><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional HP Electric Guitar is supplied with its very own Gibson hardshell aluminium case with plush lined interior. Additional accessories include the Gibson USA multi-tool, premium strap, and polishing cloth to keep your new pride and joy in pristine working condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,460-460-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/1f449703b15af932a1cbc87b828f0763.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional HP Electric Guitar","Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional HP Electric Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Paired with the top is a crisp plain maple top, which is treated to a protective coating of satin nitrocellulose lacquer for protection.</p><p>To ensure that the Tribute adheres rigidly to the classic feel of a vintage Les Paul, the body has been crafted without weight relief to create a substantial yet manageable feel in the hands. Not only that, but you are afforded a resounding sustain with plenty of vigour.</p><h3> Sturdy and responsive neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid mahogany neck, which has been treated to a slimtaper profile to encourage a fast and free-flowing playing feel. Married to the neck is a sublime rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with acrylic trapezoid position inlays to provide a stylish navigational aid. The single-cutaway body profile allows you to reach the upper frets with ease.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>The headstock is home to vintage-style keystone tuners, which uphold tuning integrity with absolute precision whilst you rock out. The partnership of tuners and Tektoid nut stabilises string tension to maintain the playing feel across each string throughout even the most energetic of performances. Fitted to the body is an aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with steel thumbwheels, as well as an aluminium stop bar tailpiece with steel posts. The bridge and tailpiece work together harmoniously to optimise intonation and sustain by creating a seamless connection between strings and body.</p><h3>Versatile humbuckers</h3><p>The Gibson USA 2018 Les Paul Tribute Electric Guitar is equipped with a pair of PAF-inspired humbuckers, with a 490R in the neck position, and a 490T in the bridge position. Control over the pickups comes via independent volume and tone pots for each pickup, as well as a three-way selector switch. To complement the luxurious overall finish, gold """"Top Hat"""" knobs have been employed. Whatever style of music you're performing, the smooth output from this pickup pairing ensures that you can carve out your tone with dexterity.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>To complete the package, the Gibson USA 2018 Les Paul Tribute Electric Guitar is supplied with a soft case to protect your new pride and joy, as well as a Gibson Accessory Kit.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,594-594-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/ebc4f638f4bd51e126fa1857e6633df9.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson USA 2018 Les Paul Tribute Guitar - Satin Faded Honeyburst","Gibson USA 2018 Les Paul Tribute Guitar - Satin Faded Honeyburst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The 524e electro-acoustic guitar is a perfect example of what they can do; combining superb tonewoods, solid build quality and electronics system that compliments the timbre of the guitar excellently.</p><p></p><p>The body shape of the 524e is arguably the most versatile body shape Taylor has designed, the Grand Auditorium. Renowned for its all-purpose characteristics, this shape is snug enough to be comfortably played by anyone, whilst the power produced is extraordinary. Whether you're a soloist or perform as part of an ensemble, a fingerstyle player or a strummer, the Grand Auditorium is suited to any musical and playing style. This is an excellent shape if you're a session musician, or simply someone who wants a guitar that covers all bases with the greatest of ease.</p><p>The Taylor 524e body has been crafted from Tropical Mahogany, chosen due to its exquisite tonal balance and articulation. Noted for having a strong midrange power, working in combination with the Grand Auditorium body shape, the 524e has a well-developed and linear tonal response, handling low-end clout, midrange power and high-end sparkle with absolute clarity.</p><p>The body has been given a gloss finish to protect from unwanted nicks and scrapes that come through playing. It also enables the guitar to cope with changes in humidity and temperature capably, making this a fantastic touring and gigging partner.</p><p>The neck is also made from Tropical Mahogany, given it a reassuringly sturdy feel in the hand. Married to the Mahogany is a sumptuous Ebony fingerboard, giving a delightfully playable surface to navigate along. The Mahogany and Ebony combine perfectly to create a highly resonant platform for the strings, guaranteeing that every note rings out with the utmost clarity.</p><p>The 524e electro-benefits from Taylor's newly designed Expression System 2 (ES2), their behind-the-saddle pickup and custom-designed """"professional-audio""""-grade preamp. As part of their never-ending quest for better tone, they shifted their usual 'under-the-saddle' design as they found that by placing the pickup behind-the-saddle, a less brittle, brash and synthetic sound could be captured. This means that no matter how aggressively you play, the natural warmth produced by the tonewoods rings out beautifully.</p><p>The control layout features the same volume and tone control knobs as on the original Expression System, with Taylor changing the gain structure of the preamp slightly to make it a little hotter. When playing live, this subtle adjustment gives the 524e the boost you need to be heard loud and clear.</p><p>High-quality hardware is used throughout to ensure a professional-level finish is achieved. Taylor nickel tuners work in partnership with the Tusq nut and Miscarta saddle to ensure tuning integrity, string tension and the string's connection to the body is perfectly maintained.</p><p>The impressive Taylor 524e also comes with its very own Taylor Deluxe Hardshell Brown case, perfect for transporting this beauty between your home, the studio and to gigs. If you're looking for a fantastic all-rounder that sounds as gorgeous as it looks, then this is the guitar for you!</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1072-1072-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/75672149b1d6a727471afcbce64cbc21.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 524e Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 524e Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The Martin 00-28VS acoustic guitar is a beautifully crafted guitar that is built to last, capable of producing richly textured tones and looks absolutely stunning. The tonally balanced grand concert body top is made from solid sitka spruce, a highly desirable tonewood that responds perfectly whether the guitar is played gently or forcefully. For this reason it delivers a wide dynamic response with a robust and consistent tone. The softer top is complemented by the solid East Indian rosewood back and sides, known for its excellent overtones and reverberant response. This gives the body a very smooth sound across the tonal range from bass to treble, articulating notes thoroughly whether you're a fingerstyle player or heavy picker.</p><p>The top of the body is reinforced using standard """"X"""" scalloped, giving it incredible strength whilst allowing it to resonate unimpeded to produce the most complete sound possible. Each brace is also carefully crafted from solid sitka spruce.</p><p>The neck is cut to the modified V profile, offering a comfortable pivot point back along the spine of the neck for players who prefer a pronounced point-of-reference when they're playing. Only the most select hardwoods are utilised in the construction of the 00-28VS neck in order to deliver a traditional look, sound and feel.</p><p>A solid black ebony fingerboard rests on top of the neck and is home to 20 frets. The shortened 24.9"""" scale length is perfectly suited to fingerstyle players or those who're looking for a slightly more compact playing area.</p><h3>Finish</h3><p>As you would expect from Martin, the guitar has been finished with appointments of the highest quality. Waverly nickel sound mount tuning machines with butterbean knobs guarantee that once you set the strings to your desired tuning, it remains fixed no matter how hard you attack them. Short pattern diamond and square inlays guide your fingers along the fretboard. The edges of the body are bound in grained ivoroid to protect from unwanted nicks whilst performing.</p><p>The body is protected by a thin yet highly resilient layer of polished gloss with aging toner, creating a vintage look that prevents unwanted rubbing and scratch marks from diminishing the wood grain.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Martin Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,929-929-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/4284c08e2075d2437719757899e49760.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Martin 00-28VS Grand Concert Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Martin 00-28VS Grand Concert Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

With the S Series, Ibanez has always led the way in producing sheer quality to suit a wide range of musicians. This Spot Run guitar is slick and innovative, while it just plays like a dream.</p> <h3>Body</h3> <p>A prominent feature of the SIX6DFM S Series model is its deep double cutaway body frame, allowing you access to the neck in its entirety. Mahogany is used to construct the body, known for its warm sound and great ability to respond to the player's technique. The body is joined by a flamed maple top which gives the guitar its striking appearance. Maple and mahogany partner one another beautifully to give you unparalleled sound.</p> <h3>Neck</h3> <p>A 3-piece maple / bubinga neck is firmly joined to the body and shaped to the Nitro Wizard profile. By employing a Nitro Wizard profile this ensures that the neck is incredibly strong and durable, but it is also very slim. This promotes faster playing techniques and encourages riffing and soloing.</p> <p>Topping the neck is a smooth bound ebony fingerboard, providing more comfort for the hand as you glide up and down. The fingerboard has a slick appearance and does not feature any inlays.</p> <h3>DiMarzio Pickups</h3> <p>Ibanez guitars are often pioneering in metal sound, and this is still the case thanks to a powerful pair DiMarzio pickups in the neck and bridge positions. These ceramic humbucker pickups add another dimension to your sound, bringing in the warmth of the mahogany body together with the bright, crisp tones of the maple top and 3-piece neck.</p> <p>The SIX6DFM has a simple control layout which features a Master Volume pot, a coil tap switch and a 3-way pickup selector switch.</p> <h3>Hardware and Finish</h3> <p>Lustrous tremolo is easy to achieve with the SIX6DFM as it is kitted out with an Edge-Zero II Tremolo bridge at the lower bout of the body. Plus, you can be safe in the knowledge that tuning will remain accurate even with plenty of tremolo use because the bridge works very well alongside the reliable Gotoh MG-T locking machine heads on the headstock.</p> <p>The neat appearance of the guitar is enhanced by matching black hardware. For metal and rock fans alike, the Ibanez SIX6DFM Spot Run is a valuable addition for any guitar collection.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Ibanez Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,830-830-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/b134e1f3b87f4217aad0709d5e18a3c3.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Ibanez SIX6DFM-BCB Electric Guitar - Blue Space Burst","Ibanez SIX6DFM-BCB Electric Guitar - Blue Space Burst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

It keeps the traditional S body shape and style for a pleasing sound and feel. By adding another string your sound becomes multi-dimensional, perfect for metallers! The SIX7FDFM guitar has a cutting-edge sound and an innovative design which will please Ibanez fans all over.</p> <h3>Body</h3> <p>The SIX7FDFM S Series model features the typical Ibanez deep double cutaway body, providing you with complete access to the neck. This allows you to reach the higher fret registers and really take advantage of the 7th string. The body is constructed from mahogany known for its warm, rich sound and ability to respond to many playing styles. A flamed maple top joins the body and looks just wonderful. Maple and mahogany partner one another beautifully to produce outstanding sonic properties.</p> <h3>Neck</h3> <p>A 3-piece maple / bubinga neck is joined to the body and shaped to the Ibanez Nitro Wizard-7 profile. The Nitro Wizard-7 neck frame is strong and durable, even with 7 strings instead of 6, but it is also very slim. This is ideal for faster players and metallers as it suits riffs and solos superbly.</p> <p>A bound ebony fingerboard tops the neck, providing a sumptuous surface beneath the fingertips. The fingerboard has has no inlays which gives it a really clean appearance.</p> <h3>DiMarzio Pickups</h3> <p>Ibanez are used to making the best guitars particularly for metal and rock enthusiasts, and they carefully select the best pickups for each model. The SIX7FDFM 7 String guitar is fitted with DiMarzio pickups in the neck and bridge positions. These ceramic humbucker pickups expand your sound, bringing in the warmth of the mahogany body together with the bright, crisp tones of the maple top and 3-piece neck. DiMarzios are well-known for their distinctive tones and ability to cover all the frequencies, which is great for a 7 string model.</p> <p>The control layout features a Master Volume pot, a coil tap switch and a 3-way pickup selector switch for easy tone shaping. The Sure Grip control knobs prevent slipping even during a heavy performance. By flipping the coil tap switch you can choose the type of voice you put out, whether you're looking to go more vintage or bring out an up-to-date contemporary sound.</p> <h3>Hardware and Finish</h3> <p>The SIX7FDFM has a Gibraltar Standard II-7 fixed bridge that holds a firm connection between the strings and body to improve sustain as the strings vibrate. Tuning stability is first-rate thanks to the reliable Gotoh MG-T locking machine heads on the headstock.</p> <p>The SIX7FDFM-DCB Spot Run Electric Guitar is yet another classic from Ibanez, ensuring excellent quality and endless sonic possibilities.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Ibanez Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,813-813-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/2706dc2b561d227ff88c9eba98314859.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Ibanez SIX7FDFM-DCB Electric Guitar - Dark Space Burst","Ibanez SIX7FDFM-DCB Electric Guitar - Dark Space Burst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

This gorgeous 12-string includes all the customary appointments you'd expect to see on a Taylor, with some fine touches that make this guitar truly unique. The Taylor 150e is built to the dreadnought body shape, giving it a solid mid to low-end power. The back and sides of the body are crafted from walnut, delivering a rich mid-range and subtle lows.</p><h3>Crafted to last a lifetime</h3><p>The laminate responds well to changes in temperature and humidity, making it very useful for those who like their guitar to travel with them wherever they go. The top is made from Sitka spruce - a favourite of Taylor's -, which has excellent resonant qualities. This allows it to project a loud sound with the utmost clarity. The top is reinforced by Taylor's 100 Series 12-string bracing, giving it more than adequate support whilst also allowing it to resonate fully.</p><h3>Expression 2 pickup system</h3><p>For times when you are playing to a large crowd and need a bit more power, the 150e is fitted with Taylor's awesome Expression System 2. The all-magnetic acoustic guitar pickup system amplifies the natural sound of the 150e, without adding colouration or distortion to the signal. Three simple controls make it very easy to adjust your tone on the go - volume, bass and treble. The neck is made using sapele, which is married to a luxurious ebony fretboard. This neck/fingerboard combination offers a warm response to the crisp brightness of the 12 strings, allowing each and every note to ring out with clear articulation.</p><p>The finishing appointments across the guitar lend themselves beautifully to the stylish aesthetic and solid functionality of the 150e. The Tusq nut and saddle guarantee that string spacing is upheld perfectly, whilst the sustain produced by the strings is maintained beautifully. Die-cast chrome mini tuning machines retain tuning integrity with absolute precision. A decorative three-ring rosette surrounds the soundhole and a black pickguard protects the body below the soundhole from unwanted picks and scrapes.</p><p>The Taylor 2017 150e is an excellent 12-string that offers shimmering notes with a sparkling complexity. If you're looking for a guitar that sounds amazing, looks gorgeous and travels well, then this is the perfect guitar for you.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1017-1017-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/bb0ef9286c9c47006eebe9d9f1332760.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 2017 150e Left Handed 12-String Electro Acoustic - Natural","Taylor 2017 150e Left Handed 12-String Electro Acoustic - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Having built an outstanding reputation for creating flawless instruments that are as beautiful to look at as they are to play and hear, Taylor continually pushes the boundaries and strives for perfection with every model they create. Not only that but their already amazing Expression System electronics - originally designed by none other than Rupert Neve - has received an update, such is their endless commitment to being the best. The 812e 12-fret electro-acoustic guitar is a perfect example of what Taylor are known for; combining superb tonewoods, solid build quality and an electronics system that compliments the timbre of the guitar perfectly, creating a sublime instrument that sets the standard for others to follow.</p><p></p><p>The 812e 12-fret is shaped to the Grand Concert body, slightly smaller when compared to a dreadnought but no less characterful. Fingerstyle players favour this shape due to its smaller size, but flatpickers and strummers will appreciate the tonal offering delivering by the Grand Concert. The sound produced is quieter than that of a dreadnought or jumbo, but thanks to a new slanted-bracing pattern, the lower frequencies are given a lift to create more linear response across the frequency range, giving it a complex and unique timbre. If you're a session player who needs a guitar that will sit perfectly within a mix between other instruments, yet still retain an individual voice amongst proceedings, then the Grand Concert shape may be just what you're looking for.</p><p>The Taylor 812e 12-fret's body back and sides have been crafted from Indian rosewood, a delightfully rich and complex tonewood that produces a full and robust mid to low-end force. The top is made from Sitka spruce - a Taylor favourite - due to its excellent resonant properties that enable it to project huge sounds with the greatest of ease. The bright-sounding spruce works wonderfully with the rosewood and body shape to create an incredibly complex tonal palette.</p><p>The body has been given a gloss finish to protect from unwanted nicks and scrapes that come through playing. It also enables the guitar to cope with changes in humidity and temperature capably, making this a fantastic touring and gigging partner. On this model Taylor have created an even slimmer coating of gloss - down from 6mm to 3.5mm - without sacrificing on its protective abilities. The natural resonant properties of the tonewoods sing more freely and deliver fuller sound than ever before.</p><p>The shortened scale length of the neck gives the guitar a much punchier sound, again emphasising the mid to low-end charge that is projected. The neck is carefully built using tropical mahogany, giving it a reassuringly sturdy feel in the hand. Married to the mahogany is a sumptuous smoked ebony fingerboard, giving a delightful surface to navigate along. The mahogany and ebony combine perfectly to create a highly resonant platform for the strings, guaranteeing that every note rings out with the utmost clarity. The neck has been treated to newly designed Mother-of-Pearl Element position inlays.</p><p>The 812e 12-fret electro-acoustic benefits from Taylor's newly designed Expression System 2 (ES2), their behind-the-saddle pickup and custom-designed """"professional-audio""""-grade preamp. As part of their never-ending quest for better tone, they shifted their usual 'under-the-saddle' design as they found that by placing the pickup behind the saddle, a less brittle, brash and synthetic sound could be captured. This means that no matter how aggressively you play, the natural warmth produced by the tonewoods rings out beautifully without colouring the signal or blemishing the natural timbre of the 812e 12-fret in any way.</p><p>The control layout features the same volume and tone control knobs as on the original Expression System, with Taylor changing the gain structure of the preamp slightly to make it a little hotter. When playing live, this subtle adjustment gives the 812e 12-fret the boost you need to be heard loud and clear.</p><p>High-quality hardware is used throughout to ensure a professional-level finish is achieved. Taylor nickel tuners work in partnership with the Tusq nut and Miscarta saddle to ensure tuning integrity, string tension and the string's connection to the body is perfectly maintained. A pale maple binding, enhances the stunning natural grain of the tonewoods and protects the body's edges.</p><p>The impressive Taylor 812e 12-fret also comes with its very own case, perfect for transporting this beauty between your home, the studio and to gigs. If you're looking for a fantastic all-rounder that can produce enormous tones, then this is the partner for you!</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1082-1082-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/ce40067da926d0b3a8f091ba8e349dbd.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 812e 12-Fret Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Taylor 812e 12-Fret Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Not only that, but the inclusion of modern improvements goes towards making the 2018 SG Standard a standout. Add a hardshell case and accessory kit and you've got yourself quite the package!</p><h3>Sublime solidbody SG</h3><p>The Gibson USA 2018 SG Standard is built and shaped to the classic slimline double-cutaway """"horns"""" profile we've all come to know and love. The unfussy yet undeniably cool design has often been imitated but never equalled. With gently bevelled edges and a balanced weight distribution, the 2018 SG is comfortable in the hands and a joy to wield. The body is crafted from mahogany, a tonewood that is favoured by Gibson due to its ability to generate masses of power infused with warmth. The finish is protected by a coating of gloss nitrocellulose lacquer that protects against unwanted blemishes detracting from the visual aesthetic.</p><h3>Fast playing neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a deftly crafted mahogany neck, which is shaped to the slimtaper profile for a lightning fast feel. Married to the neck is a luxurious rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 medium frets that have been cryogenically treated. The fingerboard is decorated with acrylic trapezoid position inlays, whilst white binding guarantees seamless transitions between every fret.</p><h3>'61 humbuckers</h3><p>To recreate classic '61 tone, the 2018 SG Standard is equipped with Gibson's 61R in the neck, and 61T in the bridge. Designed to produce a high-gain output, these humbuckers not only offer a sweet rendition of those early pickups, but also slide perfectly into modern day rock styles too. Control over the pickups comes in the form of a pair of volume pots, a pair of tone pots, and a three-way toggle switch to select either pickup independently or both simultaneously. In keeping with the vintage vibe, black 'Top Hat' knobs have been employed as the control pots.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The headstock is home to a bell-shaped chrome truss rod cover, whilst the distinctive Gibson logo resides between the locking kidney tuning machines. The tuners and Tektoid nut work dutifully to uphold tuning integrity and string tension. The body is home to the chrome finished aluminium Tune-O-Matic bridge, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar tailpiece, a combination that anchors each string securely to optimise intonation and sustain throughout the most emphatic of performances.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,598-598-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/fc044d6e286a499fd21aa7b1f13d3de2.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson USA 2018 SG Standard Electric Guitar","Gibson USA 2018 SG Standard Electric Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Control over the pickups comes in the form of """"G"""" arrow control knobs, along with a three-way pickup switch.</p><h3> Hardware </h3><p>The G5435 Pro Jet benefits from the addition of an anchored Adjusto-Matic bridge, which works in partnership with the fantastic Bigsby B50 trem tailpiece. Control over vibrato and intonation doesn't get much better, and doesn't look more beautiful than this.</p><p>The Gretsch G5435 Pro Jet with Bigsby has all the grace, style and playability of a vintage model. But thankfully, it doesn't carry a vintage price tag, and benefits from some much welcome advances in modern material and manufacturing technologies. Whether you're a rocker or a deft Jazzist, this model would make a welcome addition to any guitarist's collection.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gretsch Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,643-643-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/23e8b87e35e80b9a7a2c5267b1719821.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"G5435 Pro Jet with Bigsby","G5435 Pro Jet with Bigsby",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Whether you're an amateur who's jamming with mates, or a pro who is playing to sold-out stadium crowds, the Less Plus is an awesome guitar that is designed to impress.</p><h3> Classic Les Paul design </h3><p>The body is composed of the classic tonewood combination that includes a mahogany back with a figured maple top. The mahogany has been treated to a traditional rout, which takes some of the weight out of the wood - great for new players who're building up stamina, perfect for performers who play for hours every night - without sacrificing on timbre, tonality, or power. The mahogany produces creamy mid to low tones with a robust level of sustain. The delightful figured maple top is protected by gloss lacquer to preserve the finish for as long as possible. The maple cuts through the thickness of the mahogany with a tight high end that ensures each and every note rings out with the utmost clarity.</p><h3>Comfortable neck shape</h3><p>A sturdy mahogany neck joins the body to provide a reliable support as you play, and the rounded C profile gives it a substantial feel in the hand. Married to the neck is a sumptuous rosewood fingerboard, home to 22 highly playable frets, and bound to create a smooth playing feel. As with other 2015 models, the neck and fingerboard are now slightly wider (0.050 per side) in order to increase playing comfort and improve the execution of strings bends. Not only that but every fingerboard is smoother thanks to a new sand/buffering application, as well as a new oil treatment.</p><h3>Peerless Gibson tones </h3><p>The Gibson USA 2015 Les Paul Less Plus has been fitted with a pickup complement of '57 Classic and '57 Classic Plus humbuckers in double black exposed coils - in the neck and bridge positions respectively. If you're not already familiar with these pickups, they're modelled closely on Gibson's coveted Patent Applied For (PAF) pickups. Based around an Alnico II magnet, the '57 Classic has balanced coils that give these beauties a slightly richer tone, whilst the enamel-coated wiring ensures that at higher gain, these two pups maintain their consistency very well. Gibson have enabled coil-splits on both pickups, allowing you to pull single-coil tones from the pickups and expand the tonal versatility of the '57s even further. Whatever style of music you play, you'll easily find the tone you want with these beauties.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The nickel tune-o-matic bridge upholds intonation rigorously and stop bar tailpiece, consistently providing a secure and anchored playing feel. The zero fret nut-patent applied for nut supports each string meticulously, assuring string tension no matter what tuning you select, or how hard you rock out.</p><h3>G Force tuning</h3><p>The Gibson G FORCE system allows you to tune your guitar easily, and quickly. The user interface features an LED display for each string, along with a simple menu layout for rapid navigation. Basic functions include: multi-string tuning - simply press the On button, strum all the strings once, and when all LEDs are green, all six strings are tuned; single-string tuning, which offers greater precision; tuning adjustment - scroll through tuning presets and select a different tuning to the one currently in use, G FORCE does the work for you; and finally you can return to standard tuning at any time easily. The G FORCE system is capable of executing many advanced functions including: saving customised tunings; adjusting individual strings rapidly; and even has a capo mode, which accurately tunes each string with reference to capo placement on the 1st to 6th frets - simply amazing!</p><p>Each model is supplied with a hardshell case so that wherever your music may take you, your new pride and joy will always be as well protected as possible.</p><p>The Gibson USA 2015 Les Paul Less Plus is incredibly impressive. Reliable, tonally versatile, highly playable, lightweight, produces sustain that runs for miles, has stunning good looks, and even comes with a hardshell case, what more could you possibly want?</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,533-533-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/934369c3f076802b777dd756639b669f.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Les Paul Less Plus Electric Guitar","Gibson Les Paul Less Plus Electric Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Scalloped X-bracing reinforces the body top, enabling it to resonate freely without succumbing to buckling or warping over time. The natural finish of the tonewoods is enhanced by an antique stain that is protected by a resilient layer of nitrocellulose lacquer. Complementing that finish, as well as protecting the body top around the underside of the soundhole is a vintage firestripe pickguard. Multi-ply binding seals the top.</p><h3>Solid Mahogany Neck</h3><p>Married to the body is a solid and reliable mahogany neck, which is shaped with care to establish a substantial and supportive feel in the hand. Paired with the neck is a sumptuous rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 19-frets that are decorated with abalone diamond arrow position inlays to guide your way in style. The fingerboard is shaped to a 12-inch radius, which yields to string bends to allow a smooth and fluid motion for marvellous execution.</p><h3>Hardware Appointments</h3><p>The headstock is home to the elegant Gibson logo, with an ornate diamond arrow inlay to match those on the fingerboard. Gibson has employed gold open-back Schaller tuning machines to uphold tuning integrity, which they do so with absolute precision. The bone nut works closely with the tuning machines to maintain string tension throughout the most enthusiastic of performances.</p><p>The body is home to a Tusq saddle, which creates a seamless connection between the strings and body for a steadfast feel, optimising intonation and sustain in the process.</p><h3> L.R.

Since their introduction back in 1987, professionals from across the globe have coveted the SR series for their incredibly comfortable playing feel, and unique tonal delivery. Now players on a budget, who desire the same features as the SR series can grab a GSR model, which offer the famous Soundgear sleekness, comfort, tone, and playability, but without the bigger price tag. </p> <h3>Classic Ibanez looks</h3> <p> Ibanez know how to make an instrument look amazing. From signature models for the rich and famous - Steve Vai, Meshuggah, and Tosin Abasi - to their GSR Series, every model is crafted with huge attention to detail to give you the best in sound and feel. </p> <p> The GSR205B body is contoured to offer maximum playing comfort. Built using solid mahogany, which is a lightweight tonewood with plenty of character, this bass produces a wide-ranging tonal output, with a low to midrange rumble served with smooth high-end shimmer. </p> <p> Thanks to the extra string, you are afforded a much wider tonal range than that of a 4-string model. The lightweight nature of agathis makes it a delight to wield - perfect for those who're developing their technical abilities, and great for gigging musicians who want a bass that is easy on the back. </p> <h3> Slim Neck Profile </h3> <p> Ibanez necks are well known for their impressive strength across super slender profiles. The GSR has a maple neck that plays very fast, with a narrow shape that extends along its entire length. The double-cutaway body profile also lends itself perfectly to making each and every part of the neck easily accessible. Paired with the neck is a sublime rosewood fingerboard, home to 22-frets that is adorned with dot position inlays to help you navigate clearly. </p> <h3> PHAT-II Bass Boost </h3> <p> The GSR205B packs powerful DXH-5 neck and bridge pickups, delivering full tones with a strong low-end chug. The pickups are controlled with two volume knobs, a tone knob, and the exclusive PHAT-II bass boost control. By accessing the PHAT-II active circuitry, you can infuse immense low-end energy into your signal. Not only does this add an extra dimension to the tonal versatility of the already impressive picking pairing, but also it allows your creativity to flow. </p> <p> The GSR205 5-string bass guitar has the look and feel of models that carry a significantly higher price tag. The secure feel of the bridge, the impressive integrity of the tuning machines, the tonal versatility of the pickups, and the exquisite playing feel of the neck, all contribute to make a bass guitar that you will love to play for many a year. </p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Ibanez Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,778-778-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/627746d33219ffd05911ba331c4a1b8e.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Ibanez GSR205B-WK 5 String Bass Guitar - Weathered Black","Ibanez GSR205B-WK 5 String Bass Guitar - Weathered Black",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Mahogany has a pronounced mid to low-end rumble that is perfect for those who prefer their tone to have some meat on its bones - particularly metallers and rockers. The contoured body shape allows it to sit snugly against the body during performances, whilst the double-cutaway profile enables greater access to the upper frets. </p> <h3> GSR4 Profile Maple Neck </h3> <p> The perfectly proportioned GSR4 profile maple neck counters the low-end rumble of the mahogany beautifully, yielding a cutting mid to upper range snap. Married to the neck is a generously proportioned rosewood fingerboard, which carries 22-frets. The fingerboard makes sure that each note rings out articulately, and however you attack the strings - e.g. slap, funk, fingerpicked, flat-picked - your technique is reproduced accurately. </p> <h3> Pair of Passive PSNDJ Pickups </h3> <p> The GSR180 is equipped with passive PSNDJ pickups in the neck and bridge positions, offering a wide range of tones, which are all achievable by using the delightfully simple control setup consisting of a master tone control, and two volume level controls for each pickup. </p> <p> Finding the perfect tone for your performance couldn</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Ibanez Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,772-772-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/4ef9978fcb34103ba09471e8cfd75f84.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Ibanez GSR180-BK Bass Guitar - Black","Ibanez GSR180-BK Bass Guitar - Black",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The combination of sumptuous tonewoods, sublime natural finish, exquisitely designed pickups, and carefully considered hardware appointments, guarantees that this model stands out from the crowd as a thing of pure, unadulterated beauty to be cherished.</p><h3>Style with substance</h3><p>The instantly recognisable single-cutaway Les Paul body shape is present and correct, but the usual tonewood partnership of mahogany/maple has been traded for a mahogany/walnut combo instead. The power and warmth produced by the mahogany is tempered by the crisp character of the walnut, whilst the wood of the tonewoods is proudly displayed through a translucent protective layer of smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer. Cream binding traces around the edge of the top. The body has been treated to modern weight relief routing, making the guitar significantly lighter in weight and therefore, much more comfortable to perform with.</p><p>The body is home to the zamak tune-o-matic bridge with titanium saddles for greater resilience, which is paired with zamak stopbar tailpiece to create a seamless connection between the strings to optimise intonation and sustain. Anodized aluminium strap buttons provide ample grip to hold your strap securely.</p><h3>Neck and Fingerboard</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a single-piece mahogany neck, which is fixed using a classic mortis and tenon joint for substantial strength, and is reinforced with Titebond adhesive. The neck is shaped to a 1950s' profile, which creates an accommodating feel that is substantial without becoming cumbersome. Married to the neck is an Ironwood fingerboard, which is home to 22-frets that are adorned with mother of pearl trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. The fingerboard is shaped to a 12-inch radius, favoured by Gibson as it lends itself superbly to the execution of smooth string bends and greater freedom of movement across the strings.</p><p>At the top of the neck you'll find the headstock, which is set to Gibson's customary angle of 17-degrees to improve string tension across each string. The self-lubricating Tektoid nut guarantees durability throughout the most taxing of performances, minimising the risk of string breakages. Grover locking kidney tuning machines with an 18:1 gear ratio upholds tuning integrity with outstanding precision, whilst working harmoniously with the nut to maintain accurate string tension.</p><h3>""""Golden Era"""" Tones</h3><p>To ensure the visual elegance of this limited run model was matched by luxurious tones, Gibson fitted a '57 Classic humbucker in the neck position, and a '57 Classic Plus in the bridge, creating the coveted 'vintage' PAF-style tone. The '57 Classic has two balanced coils, enabling it to sing with a creamy warmth that is undercut with a subtle edginess that breaks up a little at high volume. The '57 Classic Plus is overwound to create a much more aggressive output that is fantastic for high gain crunch that manages to retain its brilliance and warmth.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of independent volume and tone controls that are accessible via the delightful amber """"Top Hat"""" knobs. A three-way pickup selector switch is on hand for quick changes on-the-fly. The backplate and switch plate covers are made from stainless steel infused polycarbonate for electrostatic discharge protection to prevent unwanted damage to the internal circuitry and components.</p><h3>Included Accessories</h3><p>To preserve your new pride and joy at home or on the move, Gibson has included a brown hardshell case. In addition, each model is supplied with a truss rod wrench and Gibson USA owner's manual.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,548-548-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/0a13a2adf68629ab24f16b3ff7cb22d3.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Les Paul Standard Figured Walnut Limited Run - Natural","Gibson Les Paul Standard Figured Walnut Limited Run - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The 512ce is great for singer-songwriters who want an acoustic that will accompany them, not overpower their vocals.This beautiful guitar is built to Taylor's Grand Concert body shape, arguably their most comfortable to play given the slightly smaller dimensions - also making it a superb instrument for fingerstyle players and those with limited reach. The 512ce feels very natural in the hand, and whether you're playing it seated or standing with a strap, you will feel like you can play it forever without tiring.</p><p>The back and sides of the Taylor 512ce are crafted from mahogany, which generates a nice warm low-end that delivers bags of sustain. This is married to a beautiful western red cedar top, a lyrically warm tonewood that yields a highly articulate, yet softly spoken voice.</p><p>The 512ce features a venetian cutaway, giving greater access to the upper frets so you can exploit the full frequency range available to you.</p><p>A solid tropical American mahogany neck is partnered up with a luxurious ebony fingerboard, combining to create a robust yet lively playing feel. There are 20-frets at your disposal, adorned with pearloid deco diamond inlays to guide your way.</p><p>The body and neck are both protected by a gloss finish, preserving the natural beauty of the woods for as long as possible. As well, as providing a layer of security, the gloss also creates a smooth playing feel along the neck, making it much easier to navigate.</p><p>The Taylor 512ce is fitted with Taylor's own Expression System (ES), a responsive and articulate pickup and preamp system designed in collaboration with audio pioneer Rupert Neve.</p><p>Seamlessly woven into the design and build of the guitar, the ES2 allows you to quite simply amplify and sculpt the tones produced by the 512ce when you are playing via the built in output. The onboard control system is still the same with volume and tone controls within easy access, making it incredibly simple to make changes on the fly during gigs or recording sessions.</p><p>Tortoiseshell binding supports the top whilst providing a decorative contrast against the natural grain of the cedar.

Treated to the same expert craftsmanship from Gibson's luthiers, the 2018 J-15 is an excellent electro acoustic that would suit players of all levels. Whether you're simply kicking back at home and playing along to your favourite tunes, or taking to the stage to perform to thousands of adoring fans, this is the model for you.</p><h3> Round shoulder design </h3><p>The body draws on the round shoulder dreadnought body shape for a balance of comfort and power. Using solid walnut for the back and sides, the J-15 establishes a strong midrange foundation, which utilises the dreadnought shape to full effect to produce a robust timbre. The addition of a solid Sitka spruce top allows the guitar to project with confidence. To reinforce the top, traditional hand-scalloped bracing has been employed to prevent unwanted buckling or warping of the soundboard over time.</p><p>Gibson have given the 2018 J-15 an antique natural finish, which is protected by a slender yet resilient layer of hand-sprayed nitrocellulose. You can rest assured that the understated finish of the guitar will remain in pristine condition for years to come. The soundhole is adorned with a decorative rosette, whilst multi-ply binding encircles the top with single-ply binding around the bottom.</p><h3> Two-piece maple neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body via a compound dovetail neck-to-body joint is a sturdy two-piece maple neck, which has been shaped to the slimtaper profile for comfort. Married to the neck is a walnut fingerboard, which is home to 20 frets that are adorned with mother-of-pearl dot position inlays to guide your way. The neck has also been treated to a thin layer of nitrocellulose, again to protect the wood from superficial playing wear and tear. The neck provides a substantial yet manageable feel in the hand, whilst the fingerboard offers a luxurious playground for your fingers to explore.</p><h3> L.R. Baggs Element pickup system </h3><p>The Gibson 2018 J-15 is equipped with the L.R. Baggs Element pickup system, which is designed to translate the lush acoustic timbre of the guitar with the utmost fidelity. Mirroring the soundboard's movement during performances, the responsive electronics system enables the output level of the guitar to be attenuation without adding colouration to the signal, preventing unwanted noise, feedback, compression or phasing.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>In keeping with the subtle finish, a modestly proportioned teardrop-shaped tortoise pickguard protects the lower bout of the body top from unwanted pick scrapes. Mini Grover tuning machines uphold tuning integrity dutifully, whilst the traditional rectangle-shaped walnut bridge reinforces the strings' connection to the body to optimise intonation and sustain.</p><p>Each Gibson Acoustic 2018 J-15 Electro Acoustic in Antique Natural is supplied with a hardshell case, and accessory kit.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,498-498-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/37fb42d26cb8a4a48e39a690b760e745.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Acoustic 2018 J-15 Electro Acoustic Guitar - Antique Natural","Gibson Acoustic 2018 J-15 Electro Acoustic Guitar - Antique Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Picking up a Custom 22 at the age of fifteen, Myers' love affair with PRS began and his first SE signature model was released in 2010 and each rendition has gone from strength to strength.</p><p>The single-cutaway, semi-hollow body is crafted from mahogany back and sides, married to a bevelled maple top with flame maple veneer. The semi-hollow design is accentuated with an F-hole towards the lower bout. Everything about this body design is geared towards allowing the tonewoods to resonate as fully as possible. The mahogany creates a swelling low-end, whilst the maple cuts through with a distinct clarity through the mids and highs.

For almost two centuries Martin have been pioneers in the luthier world, building a wide range of high quality guitars that produce a fantastic sound every time. The 000-15ME has the traditional dreadnought body profile and has been constructed using high-caliber material to ensure all-round quality.</p><h3>DREADNOUGHT BODY</h3><p>The 000-15ME follows suit from previous Martin models and is built with a powerful dreadnought body and 000-14 fret body size. The body, back and sides of the 000-15ME guitar is constructed solely out of solid mahogany tonewood. Martin have reinforced the body top using the A-Frame ''X-1'' bracing technique which bolsters the sound and offers a wider tonal range with a strong midrange. The use of solid mahogany allows the guitar to resonate brightly and as the 000-15ME has barely any additional appointments, it has a sincerely natural dark wooden finish. The dreadnought body profile is one of the most recognisable and adored guitar shapes and has been increasingly popular since its creation by Martin all those years ago.</p><h3>MAHOGANY NECK</h3><p>Securely fitted to the body is a solid mahogany neck to match with the solid mahogany body. The neck has a scale length of 25.4 inches and has a modified low oval shape profile which feels comfortable to play but also feels robust enough to endure more enthusiastic movements. Married to the neck is a sumptuous 20-fret solid East Indian Rosewood fingerboard, with 14 of the frets being open to you and adorned with sophisticated diamond and square position inlays to guide you up and down the neck with confidence.</p><h3>FISHMAN THINLINE GOLD+ ELECTRONICS</h3><p>Martin have fitted the Fishman Thinline Gold+ preamp to the 000-15ME guitar and enables you to play at high volumes. There is a short distance between where the undersaddle pickup sits and where the mounted preamp is, thus upholding a strong signal. The preamp works beautifully with the solid mahogany body construction to produce a clear, articulate tone whether it is played through an amp or recording equipment.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>Martin have included nickel open geared tuning machines with butterbean knobs to guarantee each string is accurately tuned, while the solid East Indian Rosewood bridge establishes a firm connection between the strings and the body so you can play with confidence.</p><p>A single ring herringbone rosette decorates the soundhole and a tortoise pickguard sits below it to offer additional protection against scratches on the body top, while giving the guitar a distinguished overall appearance.</p><p>The Martin 000-15ME is a first-rate electro acoustic guitar with a minimalistic style but is packed with great sound ability that will last the coming years the more you play it.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Martin Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,928-928-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/f033497b044cf5a978f9c612a9abee11.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Martin 000-15ME Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural","Martin 000-15ME Electro Acoustic Guitar - Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Mahogany delivers a wide-ranging tonal output, with a low to midrange rumble served with smooth high-end shimmer. The lightweight nature of mahogany makes it much easier to wield for longer amounts of time, perfect for those who're developing their technical abilities and great for gigging musicians who want an easy to play bass. </p> <h3>Smooth and comfortable neck</h3> <p> Ibanez neck profiles are amongst the most coveted in the world of guitar manufacturing, and the 5-piece maple/rosewood creation on the SR300EB is no exception.

The neck and fingerboard tonal characteristics balance out the overall tone of the bass by giving the mid to treble range more depth, as well as a fast attack when executing slap or picking techniques. </p> <h3>Versatile electronics</h3> <p> The SR300EB is fitted with the powerful active PowerSpan Dual Coil neck pickups in the neck and bridge positions.

Everything from the construction of the tonewoods to the most minute of finishing touches, has been pored over with due care and attention by the team at Gibson. The result is an outstanding model that deserves to be treasured, and is the perfect partner for taking centre stage with.</p><h3> Classic Les Paul design </h3><p>As the name suggests, Gibson has aimed to adhere as closely as possible to the Les Paul body feel that has made it the go-to guitar for so many over several decades. Therefore, the body has not been treated to any weight relief, and instead bears the weightier feel of older Les Paul models. Combined with the single-cutaway body profile, the Les Paul Traditional HP certainly lives up to its name, generating a hearty sustain and powerful timbre.</p><p>The body is crafted using mahogany, which is paired with a AAA grade flamed maple top, which is protected by a smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer. The combination of mahogany and maple creates a confident mix of mid to low-end energy with crisp and articulate highs. Cream binding has been applied around the body top to accentuate the rich finish of the top.</p><h3> Classic rounded neck with Fast-Access heel </h3><p>Fitted to the body via a classic mortis and tenon joint is the single-piece mahogany neck. Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive has been tasked with reinforcing the neck joint to maximise stability and strength. In keeping with the traditional approach, the neck has been shaped to the rounded profile, which gives the neck a more substantial feel in the hand. A new addition to the Les Paul HP is the fast-access heel on the back of the guitar, which creates a slimmer body depth for improved access to the upper frets.</p><p>Married to the neck is a sublime 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with trapezoid Mother-of-Pearl inlays to guide your way in style. The fingerboard has been increased in thickness, which makes it ideal for those who like to flex their playing muscles. Cream binding traces along the edge of the fingerboard to create seamless transitions between frets.</p><h3>Improved G-FORCE tuning system</h3><p>Gibson's G-FORCE auto-tuning system has also been given an upgrade, so that fast, accurate string tuning is now even easier than ever before. Whether you're playing in standard, using an alternate tuning, or making up your own that you can save and recall at a later time, you'll be amazed at how smoothly the G-FORCE system operates - and also at how quietly the synchronized spur gear system operates too.</p><h3> Resilient, stage-ready hardware </h3><p>The titanium zero-fret adjustable nut guarantees exceptional tone, sustain and durability. Total action control means that the playing feel will remain uniform no matter how much you rock out, and the useful locking feature prevents unwanted alteration. The Gibson logo adorns the top of the headstock, with a gold """"Les Paul Model"""" silkscreen resting between the tuning pegs. Angled to Gibson's customary 17-degrees to improve tuning stability and string tension, the Les Paul Standard HP is built to endure anything you can throw at it.</p><p>The body is home to the aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with titanium saddles and locking thumbwheels, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar with locking studs. The bridge and tailpiece partnership works dutifully to ensure intonation and sustain is optimised so that your Les Paul sings beautifully, and with the richness it deserves.</p><h3>Burstbucker 2 and 3+ humbucker pickups</h3><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional HP Electric Guitar has been fitted with a Burstbucker 2 and 3+ humbuckers, fitted in the neck and bridge positions respectively. The Alnico II-powered Burstbuckers translate the richness of the body tonewoods, and the articulation of the neck and fingerboard construction with impeccable clarity. They produce the same glorious Gibson tones we all know and love, with a little added bite compared to their model T counterparts.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of new push-pull knurled knobs, which are finished in chrome to accentuate the stunning body finish. The switchable functions on offer are: to Tap or Split either pickup; activate an integrated High Pass Filter; or introduce transient suppression. The range of tones on offer is truly staggering, and you'll wonder how you ever got by without this guitar in your arsenal during any studio session or tour.Included Accessories</p><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional HP Electric Guitar is supplied with its very own Gibson hardshell aluminium case with plush lined interior. Additional accessories include the Gibson USA multi-tool, premium strap, and polishing cloth to keep your new pride and joy in pristine working condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,463-463-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/1f449703b15af932a1cbc87b828f0763.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional HP Guitar - Honey Burst","Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional HP Guitar - Honey Burst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Taylor's Baby Taylor models are considered to be some of the world's best travel guitars thanks to their comfortable, compact sizing, and the BTe-Koa is yet another satisfactory addition to the list. Travelling musicians will be huge fans of the BTe-Koa thanks to its unique voice and versatile playing feel.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>The BTe-Koa has a compact dreadnought body shape reduced into a 3/4 size acoustic guitar rather than a full size model. Despite the guitar's smaller frame, the BTe-Koa produces an excellent range of tones with fantastic clarity. The body of the Baby Taylor has been made entirely from Koa tonewood which looks and sounds just exquisite. Koa is a Hawaiian wood and is quite rare in the world of guitar construction. The all-Koa body contributes an incredibly warm voice, yet also has a wonderfully striking appearance. For reinforced strength and dependability, the soundboard features unique X-bracing just beneath the surface.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>A tropical American mahogany neck is firmly fitted to the all-Koa body and has a slightly shorter 22 3/4 inch scale length, facilitating a faster playing technique. The neck is topped with a 19-fret ebony fingerboard with decorative pearloid dot inlays as a guide, so each fret transition can be made with confidence.</p><h3>Expression System Baby Electronics</h3><p>Taylor have kitted out the BTe-Koa with the excellent Expression System Baby (ES-B) onboard preamp / pickup. The onboard electronics feature elements of the Taylor Expression System 2 piezo pickup with the addition of a very convenient digital chromatic tuner. You can make subtle tweaks to your sound using the simple Volume and Tone controls. When the preamp is not in use for over three minutes, the ES-B can switch itself off to save battery power and improve efficiency.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>The headstock is fitted with enclosed die-cast chrome plated tuning machines, upholding tuning integrity with total accuracy. Sustain and intonation is improved thanks to a Tusq nut and saddle combined with the ebony bridge.

Whatever style of music you play, the EB is a tonally versatile wonder that is perfect for everyone from amateurs to professionals. Whether you're recording tracks in the studio or hitting the stage, the EB Bass 5 String T Bass allows you to get the job done in style.</p><h3> Sophisticated EB profile </h3><p>The body has been crafted using Swamp ash, which is a tonewood that is highly regarded by luthiers thanks to its richness of tone and girthy midrange energy. Though it produces an enviably powerful sound, the wood is surprisingly light in weight, lending itself sweetly to a comfortable playing feel. The body has been shaped in accordance with a cool ergonomic design, with contoured edges and deep double-cutaways to guarantee unimpeded access to the upper frets.</p><h3> Robust rounded neck </h3><p>With the addition of the 5th string, Gibson have gone to great lengths to ensure the playability and feel of the neck is as accessible as that of its 4 string counterpart. With this in mind, the neck is crafted using maple, which is shaped to a rounded profile to offer a substantial feel in the hand whilst retaining a manageable comfortability. Maple offers a bright counterpoint to the swamp ash to offer articulation across each and every note.</p><p>Married to the neck is a sumptuous rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 24 frets that are adorned with dot position inlays to guide your way in style. The generous 34-inch scale length of the neck is paired with a 12-inch fingerboard radius, laying the foundation for an accommodating playing surface for your fingers to explore.</p><h3> EB Rhythm and Lead Humbuckers </h3><p>With a tone wood combo as potent as this, some equally powerful pickups are in order. Two Alnico V magnet-powered humbuckers are equipped, which deliver a high-gain output with fat tone. Each of these has its own volume control, so that tones can be blended from each pickup, whilst a master tone pot allows you to embellish output from low to high frequencies.</p><h3> Stage-ready hardware </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a Babicz full-contact bridge, which creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain. The headstock is home to Grover tuners which provide stability throughout the most energetic of performances with a durable 20:01 tuning ratio. The newly appointed self-lubricating TekToid nut also works tirelessly to upheld sustain and pitch accuracy.</p><h3> Included Accessories </h3><p>The Gibson 2017 EB Bass 5 String T Bass Guitar is supplied with a Gibson EVF gig bag to protect your pride and joy at home and on the move. Along with the gig bag, each model is supplied with a Gibson USA guitar strap, polishing cloth, truss rod wench, and 2.5mm adjustment wrench to help you keep your EB Bass in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,419-419-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/6058823a82f0b4277e835d55649da097.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 EB Bass 5 String T Bass Guitar","Gibson 2017 EB Bass 5 String T Bass Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

The neck has a more comfortable Slim Taper profile which enhances and promotes a faster playing style.</p><p>Topping the neck is a thicker rosewood fingerboard with a 12 inch radius and 22 frets to explore. The thickness of the rosewood is a contributor to the tonal depth on offer from this stunning 2017 model. Frets feature the traditional trapezoid inlays to guide you. A Tektoid nut that is self-lubricating has also been fitted for a better return to pitch and improved sustain.</p><h3>ELECTRONICS</h3><p>The 2017 Les Paul Studio T has been equipped with a pair of superb humbucker pickups; a 490R pickup in the neck position powered by an Alnico II magnet, and a 498T pickup powered by an Alnico V magnet in the bridge position. Each pickup has been crafted to replicate authentic PAF-style Gibson tones, while they also work relentlessly to cancel out any unwanted noise or interference for a much cleaner output.</p><p>The Les Paul Studio T features four control pots for rhythm and lead Volume and Tone, including two push/pull controls for independent coil tapping.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>For unrivalled sustain and resonance, the body is fitted with a chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge accompanied by an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece, the most modern bridge/tailpiece combination that there is.</p><p>The headstock is fitted with Grover Kidney chrome-plated tuning keys set to an accurate 18:01 gear ratio.</p><p>A protective Les Paul pickguard preserves the body top against scratches, while also complementing the finish of the guitar.

This gorgeous 12-string offers shimmering notes with a sparkling complexity. If you're looking for a guitar that sounds amazing, looks gorgeous and travels well, then this is the perfect guitar for you. This left-handed model is treated with the same due care and attention shown to all Taylor models, guaranteeing the high standard of quality we've come to expect from such an illustrious company.</p><h3>Powerful Dreadnought Body</h3><p>The 150e is built to the powerful dreadnought body shape, giving it a solid mid to low-end power. The back and sides of the body are crafted using sapele laminate, reinforcing the lower-end charge whilst maintaining great resilience in dealing with changes in temperature and humidity - a characteristic that is particularly useful to those who like their guitar to travel with them wherever they go.</p><p>The top is made from Sitka spruce - a favourite of Taylor's -, which has excellent resonant qualities that allows it to project the timbre of the guitar efficiently. The top is reinforced by Taylor's 100 Series 12-string bracing, giving it more than adequate support to prevent buckling or warping over time, whilst allowing it to resonate fully.</p><h3>Supportive Sapele Neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a reassuringly solid sapele neck, which is paired with a delightful 20-fret ebony fingerboard that is adorned with 6mm dot position inlays. The neck is treated to a varnish that guarantees a smooth and responsive playing feel, whilst preserving the longevity of the wood.</p><h3>Road-Ready Hardware</h3><p>The finishing appointments across the guitar lend themselves beautifully to the stylish aesthetic and solid functionality of the 150e. The Tusq nut and saddle guarantee that string spacing is upheld perfectly, whilst the sustain produced by the strings is maintained beautifully. Die-cast chrome mini tuning machines retain tuning integrity with absolute precision. A decorative three-ring rosette surrounds the soundhole and a black pickguard protects the body below the soundhole from unwanted picks and scrapes.</p><h3>Taylor's Expression System Electronics</h3><p>For times when you are playing to a large crowd and need a bit more power, the 150e is fitted with Taylor's awesome Expression System. The all-magnetic acoustic guitar pickup system amplifies the natural sound of the 150e, without adding colouration or distortion to the signal.</p><p>Three simple controls make it very easy to adjust your tone on the go - volume, bass and treble. The neck is made using sapele, which is married to a luxurious ebony fretboard. This neck/fingerboard combination offers a warm response to the crisp brightness of the 12 strings, allowing each and every note to ring out with clear articulation.</p><p>The Taylor 150e left-handed dreadnought electro acoustic guitar in natural comes equipped with Elixir Phosphor Bronze Medium strings, as well as a gig bag to get you up and running for your first gig from the moment it arrives.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1030-1030-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/35da213c1ca3ae9a13f7fe7ddd4f9eed.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 150e Left-Handed 12-String Dreadnought Electro Acoustic Guitar","Taylor 150e Left-Handed 12-String Dreadnought Electro Acoustic Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Composed using a range of high quality, hard-wearing materials, and equipped with advanced onboard electronics, it's hard not to be impressed by it.</p><h3>GRAND AUDITORIUM BODY</h3><p>The 214ce DLX is built to Taylor's most popular, versatile Grand Auditorium shape with added Venetian cutaway. This is a true Taylor original body shape, first designed in 1994 as a middle-ground between a Dreadnought and Grand Concert style body. The addition of the Venetian cutaway provides you with complete access to the upper frets, allowing the player to vary their acoustic registers.</p><p>Sitka spruce is commonly the tonewood of choice in acoustic soundboards, and this remains the case with the 214ce DLX, thanks to its articulate ability to project a full-bodied, crystal-clear acoustic voice. The forward shifted bracing pattern further stabilises the body top. Layered sapele not only looks good in the back and sides but also ensures the body has a long-lasting construction. The body is given a delicate yet resilient gloss finish to prevent tackiness or stickiness from occurring, whilst adding overall protection.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>Sapele is also used in the neck and heel, and it is firmly fitted to the body via a scarf neck joint. The neck has a satin-treated finish which adds to its slender feel. Topping the neck is a 20-fret smooth ebony fingerboard decorated with small diamond inlays as your guide.</p><h3>EXPRESSION 2 ELECTRONICS</h3><p>The 214ce DLX is enhanced by the new Expression 2 onboard electronics, which feature an advanced behind-the-saddle pickup and custom-designed """"professional-audio""""-grade preamp. Rather than using the """"under-the-saddle"""" pickup design, the behind-the-saddle pickup ensures that each note and chord that is played is pickup and perfectly translated. It also means that the natural warmth produced by the tonewoods is not compromised, and its acoustic voice can ring out with beautiful, clear intonation.</p><p>The main change in the Expression system is the Gain feature, allowing for hotter tones, but the Volume and Tone controls remain the same. This is a welcome improvement, particularly for live musicians.</p><p>The 214ce DLX in Black is a stunning electro acoustic model that appeals to a wide-ranging audience, with that superb Venetian cutaway Grand Auditorium body and finished with a decorative three ring pearloid rosette and white binding. Taylor also include a standard hardshell case in brown to protect the guitar out on the road.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Taylor Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,1060-1060-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/51b7ddf67b1d74fafe3048a363454ac1.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Taylor 214ce DLX Electro Acoustic Guitar - Black","Taylor 214ce DLX Electro Acoustic Guitar - Black",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Gibson have got the perfect mix of """"tradition and innovation"""", combining original, time-honoured appointments with some incredible upgrades to attract modern players.</p><h3>BODY</h3><p>As with the majority of Gibson electric guitars, the 2017 SG Standard HP has a mahogany body. One of the most radical features of the SG when it was first released was the double cutaway body, which is still the same today. The SG Standard HP is equipped with a fast access heel for exceptional, easy reach to every fret, further boosted by the double cutaway.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>A smooth, Soloist mahogany neck is fitted to the SG Standard HP, providing extra room to play with. The neck has a Slim Taper profile, a popular choice for those who have a preference towards a much faster playing style.</p><p>The neck is topped with a sumptuous, dark rosewood fingerboard with a 12 inch radius and 22 easy-to-reach frets. Classic Mother of Pearl trapezoid inlays decorate the frets, guiding you from one to the next with complete confidence. For unrestricted control over string action and better sustain there is a titanium zero-fret adjustable nut with locking feature.</p><h3>ELECTRONICS</h3><p>Gibson have employed a pair of classic humbucker pickups in the 2017 SG Standard HP, with a '57 Classic in the neck position and a '57 Classic + in the bridge position. The '57 Classic humbuckers are designed to accurately replicate the original PAF-style tone heard on the original SG models many years ago.</p><p>The controls follow suit on previous models, with four knobs for rhythm and lead Volume and Tone, plus a 3-way pickup toggle switch to shape your SG sound. With upgraded wiring for the 2017 model, the controls work brilliantly to offer the desired tone you're looking for. The chrome-plated knobs and switch tip are designed to improve grip, so even on a dark, hot stage you'll have no problem making adjustments.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>There is updated, modern chrome hardware featured on the SG Standard HP, from the bell-shaped truss rod cover, tuning keys, Gibson logo and crown on the headstock to the bridge, tailpiece and control knobs. The headstock is now fitted with an improved version of the G FORCE automatic tuning system. Retuning your strings is a doddle with this accurate system, plus it has been calibrated to prevent any unwanted noise or interference.</p><p>A traditional chrome-plated aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge is fitted to the lower bout of the body with titanium saddles joined by an aluminium Stop Bar tailpiece with locking studs for top quality sustain and resonance.</p><p>The small teardrop pickguard is designed to both protect and complement the stunning finish of the SG Standard HP, while the white fingerboard binding on the neck also helps complete the look. Gibson include a premium Gibson aluminium hard case, strap and polishing cloth with the purchase of a 2017 SG Standard HP, enabling the new owner to keep it in the finest condition for years to come.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,486-486-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/b90ddbb34e270b24c9d1d8fe229cbec6.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 SG Standard HP Electric Guitar - Cherry Burst","Gibson 2017 SG Standard HP Electric Guitar - Cherry Burst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

It is designed to be loved and appreciated, not only by the guitarist playing it, but by the people you're sharing you music and passion with too.</p><p>The body is shaped to Martin's grand performance-style, which combines a large lower bout to give a full low-end rumble and a slimmer waist to create sweetly crisp highs. The lower bout is more in keeping with that of a jumbo-shape, which allows it to produce massive amounts of power, but this gently tapers off towards the neck.</p><p>The combination of tonewoods that have been used to craft the GPCPA4 are solid sapele for the back and sides with a solid Sitka spruce top. The sapele is excellent at creating richly textured and complex tones, generating a character that makes each model unique. The spruce top is incredibly flexible, which allows it to project sound efficiently. Therefore, you can expect unrivalled clarity across the dynamic range - whether you play fingerstyle or with a plectrum.</p><p>Martin's hybrid """"X"""" scalloped bracing pattern allows the top to resonate fully whilst supporting it fully. You can rest assured that as with all guitars that Martin produce, the GPCPA4 is a workhorse that is most definitely built to last - playing the guitar extensively allows the tonewoods to develop their own individual character, making each model incredibly special as it becomes a true representation of the love and energy you put into it.</p><p>An exquisitely detailed Delmar tortoiseshell colour pickguard protects the underside of the strings. The edging around the top is protected by black boltaron binding to ensure no unwanted nicks or chips affect the soundboard's ability to perform.</p><p>The select hardwood neck is combined with a black richlite fingerboard. Both work together to create a crisp and articulate measure against the powerful body shape and tonewoods. No matter how hard you may strike the strings, you will only ever get a joyful tone of the utmost definition. Offset white ABS dots guide your way up the fingerboard as you play.</p><p>To make the GPCPA4 truly versatile, Martin have installed the Fishman F1 analog electronics system, allowing you to take you sound to the next level and play to a much larger audience. The Fishman F1 perfectly represents the tonal output of the GPCPA4 without distortion of the signal, simply amplifying it. This is exemplified by the simplistic control setup of a single volume control and a single tone control. Simply plug in using the 1/4"""" jack and you're good to go. There is even a built-in digital chromatic tuner to keep you in check, and a low battery indicator guarantees you can always be ready to play.</p><p>The Martin GPCPA4 is a beautiful electro acoustic, completed in a shaded natural finish that is perfect for guitarists/singer-songwriters who're looking for a guitar that offers power and precision. It comes with a 375 hardshell case so you're ready to gig as soon as it arrives.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Martin Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,963-963-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/9dd5e69f3881f48a1256c1da59061f14.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Martin GPCPA4 Electro Acoustic Guitar - Shaded Natural","Martin GPCPA4 Electro Acoustic Guitar - Shaded Natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Incorporating exotic tonewoods, reliable hardware, superb Taylor electronics and a glorious finish, the 220ce-K DLX is an outstanding model that any guitarist will love.</p><h3> Powerful dreadnought body </h3><p>The 220ce-K DLX is built to the powerful dreadnought body profile, which marries comfortability with a confident projection that has helped it to become one of the most popular body shapes of all time. Whether you're a soloist or perform as part of an ensemble, the dreadnought ensures that your tone will ring out loud and clear.</p><p>The back and sides are crafted using layered koa, a durable tonewood that generates a warm midrange energy. The layered design of the back and sides allows the body to cope with changes in humidity and temperature resiliently. The top is built from Hawaiian Koa, which ensures a breath taking visual aesthetic, as well as developing a rich and luxurious character during the course of its lifetime. The body has received a slender yet durable gloss coating to prevent tackiness or stickiness from occurring, whilst adding protection to the heavenly natural finish.</p><h3>Sturdy sapele neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a sturdy sapele neck, which has been treated to a satin coating that ensures a smooth playing feel. Paired with the neck is a sumptuous ebony fingerboard, which is home to 20-frets that are adorned with small diamond inlays to provide a stylish navigational aid.</p><h3>Taylor's Expression System 2</h3><p>The 220ce-K DLX benefits from Taylor's newly designed Expression System 2 (ES2), their behind-the-saddle pickup and custom-designed """"professional-audio""""-grade preamp. As part of their never-ending quest for better tone, they shifted their usual 'under-the-saddle' design as they found that by placing the pickup behind the saddle, a less brittle, brash and synthetic sound could be captured. This means that no matter how aggressively you play, the natural warmth produced by the tonewoods rings out beautifully without colouring the signal or blemishing the natural timbre of the guitar in any way.</p><p>The control layout features the same volume and tone control knobs as on the original Expression System, with Taylor changing the gain structure of the preamp slightly to make it a little hotter. When playing live, this subtle adjustment gives the 220ce-K DLX the boost you need to be heard loud and clear.</p><p>If it's a stylish yet understated model you're looking for, then the Taylor 220ce-K DLX electro acoustic guitar is perfect.

The neck and fingerboard partnership establishes a confident playing feel, encouraging your fingers to roam freely. The 12-inch fingerboard radius allows your fretting hand to roll around in comfort, whilst string bends can be executed smoothly. The single cutaway body profile makes it significantly easier to reach the upper frets comfortably.</p><h3> Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck is a Graph Tech nubone nut, which works in partnership with the vintage-style open-back tuning machines to uphold string tension and tuning integrity.</p><h3> Blacktop Filter'Tron pickups </h3><p>Fitted to the body are two BlackTop Filter'Tron humbuckers in the neck and bridge positions. Designed to enhance the """"fat"""" timbre produced by the body, this pair produce an enviable tonal arsenal for you to play with. The neck position enhances the plucky articulation of the neck and fingerboard, whilst the bridge pickup draws more from the body, generating a thunderous charge when you want it.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes in the form of a three-way pickup selector toggle switch, which allows you to select either pickup independently or select both outputs simultaneously for a fuller tone. Each pickup has an independent volume knob, and both are connected to master volume and tone pots.</p><h3> Bigsby Licensed B60 vibrato tailpiece </h3><p>Fitted to the G5420T is an adjusto-matic bridge with a secured rosewood-based, which is paired with a glorious Bigsby Licensed B60 vibrato tailpiece. The hardware creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain, whilst the Bigsby offers meticulous control over vibrato.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gretsch Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,622-622-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/fe1861ae4b87d48659f19462f037a8e9.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"G5420T Electromatic Hollowbody, Bigsby - Fairlane Blue","G5420T Electromatic Hollowbody, Bigsby - Fairlane Blue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Many guitarists will think of the SG as having the traditional pairing of humbucker pickups, though the variant is fitted with two single coil pickups, giving this SG a unique voice. In its immaculate Satin Vintage Sunburst finish, this Limited Run SG has it all.</p><h3>BODY</h3><p>The Gibson SG has an incredibly distinct look, with the double cutaway solidbody design. In comparison to other Gibson models, the SG has a simple construction, while its lightweight feel and contoured body ensure an ultimately comfortable playing experience. The Limited Run is no different, weighing just 2.63kg, it sits wonderfully against your body.</p><p>The body is made using mahogany; a reliable, popular tonewood for electric guitars. It contributes to the definitive voice of the SG and adds strength to the guitar to enable it to withstand the test of time.</p><h3>NECK</h3><p>Firmly joined to the body is a smooth, 24.75 inch scale mahogany set-in neck which maintains its traditional slender feel, thus promoting a much faster playability.

Two single coil pickups are fitted to this SG, with a P90SR in the neck position joined by a P90ST in the bridge position. The neck pickup provides a percussive feel combined with the bridge pickup which gives you a clean, chiming treble voice. Each pickup is designed using the superb Alnico V rod magnets, recreating a genuine vintage tone.</p><p>Gibson have selected just two main controls for Master Volume and Master Tone, plus a 3-way toggle pickup switch, so you can easily search for your ideal timbre.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The lower bout of the body is fitted with a Tune-o-Matic bridge with a traditional Stopbar tailpiece, establishing better sustain and resonance with each note.</p><p>Gibson include a gig bag and Certificate of Authenticity with the purchase of this magnificent SG Single Coil Limited Run guitar, allowing you to keep it in the best possible condition for many years to come.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,555-555-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/bdb9acd446a2d26042470f85ccf2893f.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson SG Special Single Coil Ltd Run - Satin Vintage Sunburst","Gibson SG Special Single Coil Ltd Run - Satin Vintage Sunburst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Whether you're taking to the studio or hitting the stage, the SR405EQM model is equipped with everything you need to get the job done in style. </p> <h3>Sleek SR body profile</h3> <p> The SR405 adopts the standard we've come to expect from the SR body profile, with a shallow body depth that is paired with gently bevelled edges and figure-hugging contours. Whether you like to play with your fingers or a pick, wear your bass high or sling it low, the body design removes any obstacles from the path of your picking hand whilst guaranteeing a comfortable playing position. The deep double-cutaways open the higher frets to be accessed with ease, ensuring that each and every fret is at your disposal. </p> <p> The lightweight body is crafted from solid mahogany, which establishes a warm midrange foundation that packs a punch.

The neck is shaped to the exceptionally comfortable SR5 profile to minimise fatigue during those long performances. Married to the neck is a 24 medium fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with white dot position inlays to guide your way in style. </p> <h3>Versatile electronics</h3> <p> The SR405EQM is fitted with a pair of versatile PowerSpan dual-coil passive humbucking pickups in the neck and bridge positions. The pickups are voiced to bring out the best from SR405EQM, enhancing the warmth of the mahogany along with the bite of the maple. Shaping your tone to suit your musical style can be done using the master volume knob, whilst attenuating the pickup focus using the balancer pot. Ibanez' custom 3-band EQ with Power Tap switch is built-in to the bass, expanding the potential of your tonal arsenal. At your disposal are the Boost/Cut pots for Bass, Mid, and Treble for shaping the frequency response of the pickups with absolute precision. The Power Tap switch has 3 modes: Tap, Series, and Power Tap. Each one enables you to focus your output tone with regard to creating a punchy, dynamic response with impressive articulation, a full, warm tone, and a mixture between the two for single-coil clarity combined with the thick low-end depth of a humbucker. </p> <h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3> <p> Fitted to the body is an Accu-cast B305 bridge, which anchors the strings securely to create a seamless connection between them and the body to optimise intonation and sustain.

The headstock is home to Grover tuners which provide stability throughout the most energetic of performances with a durable 20:01 tuning ratio.

Traditional hand-scalloped X-bracing is on hand to reinforce the top whilst allowing it to resonate unimpeded.</p><p>The vintage cherry sunburst finish is beautiful, and the accompanying pickguard with ornate Hummingbird inlay is a feast for the eyes. The body is encircled with 6-ply binding and protected by a subtle yet resilient nitrocellulose lacquer. The lower bout of the Hummingbird is fitted with a traditional belly-up rosewood bridge, and like the fingerboard, the bridge is treated with a new finishing oil which gets right into the wood to ensure that it will last even longer. The anchored support of the bridge ensures that intonation and sustain rings out for as long as possible.</p><h3>Solid rounded neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a solid mahogany neck, which is shaped to the round profile that offers a reassuringly substantial yet manageable feel in the hand. Using a compound dovetail joint reinforced by hot hide glue, the neck is as solid as they come. At the top of the neck you'll find a Tusq nut, which works alongside gold Grover Keystone tuning machines that upholds tuning integrity and string tension immaculately. Paired with the neck is a heavenly rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 20 frets that are decorated with mother of pearl parallelogram position inlays to guide your way in style.</p><h3> L.R. Baggs Element VTC Pickup System </h3><p>Equipped with the award-winning L.R. Baggs Element VTC electronics' system, you can take to the stage in effortless style and plug directly into the amp or P.A. of your choosing, safe in the knowledge that the acoustic character of your guitar will be translated transparently.</p><p>The pre-attached Element pickup, and all-discrete endpin preamp are controlled using the soundhole-mounted volume and tone controls. The built-in low frequency crossover prevents any unwanted low-end grunt from over-powering your signal, and allows the natural timbre of the Hummingbird to sing with the utmost clarity.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,508-508-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/2a2dbfc607605c72db4363e06c7fd54f.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Acoustic 2018 Hummingbird Guitar - Vintage Cherry Sunburst","Gibson Acoustic 2018 Hummingbird Guitar - Vintage Cherry Sunburst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Closely associated with blues, the ES-335 has been favoured by many rock players too, thanks to the innovative centre-block design that enables amplification without the unwanted noise or feedback. The body is constructed using 3-ply maple/poplar/maple for the top, back and sides, which creates a beautifully balanced tonal palette, as well as a lightweight feel in the hands.

The hand-wired electronics with ceramic capacitors ensure that any attenuation is done with absolute subtlety.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The body is equipped with an ABR-1 bridge that features plated brass saddles, which is paired with a die-cast zinc tailpiece. The result is a lightweight yet exceptionally strong and reliable system to uphold intonation and sustain across each and every string. The headstock is home to Grover 102 Rotomatic tuning machines, which maintain tuning with steadfast dedication.

Whatever style of music you're tackling, the 2017 EB Bass is a mighty performance partner for both amateur and professional players alike.</p><h3> Sophisticated EB profile </h3><p>Swamp ash is the tonewood of choice, and is perfect as the driving power behind the EB Bass. Highly regarded thanks to its rich warmth and depth of tone, Swamp Ash also boasts a relatively lightweight feel along with its big-hearted tone. The body is treated to a deep double-cutaway profile, making easy to reach the upper frets in comfort. The body has a contoured edge, which creates a comfortable rest for the picking arm, and allows the body to sit snugly against your body during performances.</p><h3> Robust rounded neck </h3><p>The neck is crafted using maple, which is shaped to a rounded profile to offer a substantial feel in the hand. Maple offers a bright counterpoint to the swamp ash to offer articulation across each and every note.

The generous 34-inch scale length of the neck is paired with a 12-inch fingerboard radius, laying the foundation for an accommodating playing surface for your fingers to explore.</p><h3> EB Rhythm and Lead Humbuckers </h3><p>With a tone wood combo as potent as this, some equally powerful pickups are in order. Two Alnico V magnet-powered humbuckers are equipped, which deliver a high-gain output with fat tone. Each of these has its own volume control, so that tones can be blended from each pickup, whilst a master tone pot allows you to embellish output from low to high frequencies.</p><h3> Stage-ready hardware </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a Babicz full-contact bridge, which creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain. The headstock is home to Grover tuners which provide stability throughout the most energetic of performances with a durable 20:01 tuning ratio. The newly appointed self-lubricating TekToid nut also works tirelessly to upheld sustain and pitch accuracy.</p><h3> Included Accessories </h3><p>The Gibson 2017 EB Bass 4 String T Bass Guitar is supplied with a Gibson EVF gig bag to protect your pride and joy at home and on the move.

Introduced in 1960, the Hummingbird has been famously adopted by any music legends throughout its lifetime - from Gram Parsons to Keith Richards -, owing to its delightfully versatile timbre that makes it great for everything from folk to country to rock. This modern rendition adheres closely to the classic fit, finish and feel of the original, and is a truly beautiful model.</p><h3>Classic Hummingbird body</h3><p>The Hummingbird is regarded as Gibson's first square-shoulder dreadnought acoustic guitar, which combined a solid build quality that comprised a shallow upper bout alongside a more generously endowed lower bout. The body depth offers ample room for the tonewoods to generate a powerful energy, whilst retaining a comfortable playing feel. The body has been crafted using mahogany for the back and sides, which is delivered exquisitely by the grade AA solid Sitka spruce soundboard. The spruce is reinforced using radiused scalloped bracing, which enhances the guitar's ability to resonate whilst ensuring that it retains a resilient and sturdy feel.</p><p>The ebony finish is protected by a slender layer of smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer, which is partnered with the instantly recognisable Tortoise Hummingbird pickguard.</p><h3>Solid rounded neck</h3><p>A mahogany neck is firmly fitted to the body via the compound dovetail joint for improved resonance. The neck is shaped to a round profile, offering a smooth playing feel. Aboard the neck is a rosewood fingerboard, presenting you with 20 frets and decorated beautifully with Mother-of-Pearl parallelogram inlays.</p><p>The neck and fingerboard feel more comfortable than ever thanks to the softened fingerboard edge which is designed to fit perfectly in the hand. Gibson have gone the extra mile to make this limited-edition Hummingbird feel like the best acoustic playing surface, and this is a result of the German-engineered, hand-finished Plek technology used in the construction of all Gibson acoustics.</p><h3>Hardware and Finish</h3><p>The lower bout of the Hummingbird is fitted with a traditional belly up rosewood bridge, and like the fingerboard, the bridge is treated with a new finishing oil which gets right into the wood to ensure that it will last even longer.</p><p>The headstock of the Hummingbird is equipped with nickel Grover Rotomatic tuning keys, accurately maintaining the tuning of each string in conjunction with the Tusq saddle.</p><p>The Gibson Acoustic Hummingbird Limited Run Acoustic Guitar in Ebony is a gorgeous model that would make a welcome addition to any guitarists arsenal, and is perfect for recording and performing with.

PRS have taken inspiration from the more traditional, vintage features of their core models while adding some new and improved appointments for an all-round, well-built electric guitar. Whether you're used to a 22-fret axe or are looking for something a little bit more conventional, the 2017 SE Custom 22 is an excellent choice.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>PRS guitars are often easily recognised by their elegant double cutaway bodies, and this is also the profile of the 2017 SE Custom 22. Thanks to the double cutaway you have full access to all of the frets on the neck. The beveled maple top features a striking flame maple veneer which shines through the paintwork. Mahogany is used to construct the body back offering a beautiful tonewood partnership with the maple top.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>The 25 inch scale length 2017 SE Custom 22 is firmly joined by a maple neck for a smooth playing feel in the hand. The neck has a wide thin profile which is suited to faster players and lead guitarists. Topping the neck is a rosewood fingerboard which hosts 22 frets with the time-honoured bird inlays to guide you.</p><h3>Upgraded Pickups</h3><p>The 2017 SE Custom 22 has been fitted with a pair of excellent humbucker pickups in the neck and bridge positions. Paul Reed Smith voiced the pickups to imitate the pickups found in core PRS models for an unparalleled tone. The updated 85/15 """"S"""" pickups produce sweet highs that chime magnificently. The low and midrange notes are clear-cut, offering you a universe of tones to explore. The 85/15 """"S"""" dual humbuckers are a coveted pair of pickups, especially as you can only get these when you purchase a core PRS model from the range.</p><p>The controls have a simple setup but have everything you need to tweak Volume and Tone. There is also a 3-way toggle switch to alter between pickup combinations.</p><h3>Hardware and Finish</h3><p>The lower bout of the body is fitted with a PRS-designed tremolo bridge to perform excellent pitch bends. You need not worry about going out of tune as the PRS-designed tuners ensure total tuning accuracy. The headstock also features an updated logo with Paul Reed Smith's signature above the """"SE"""". The nickel hardware adds a neat visual aesthetic to the flame maple veneer finish.</p><p>The PRS 2017 SE Custom 22 is an electric guitar that fuses vintage inspiration in its sound and feel with the classic, meticulous PRS setup, so it's ready to play from the moment you take it out of the box.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,PRS,TRUE,,,,,,,982-982-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/864fa131fc114df12c049dccb15beb65.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"PRS 2017 SE Custom 22 Electric Guitar","PRS 2017 SE Custom 22 Electric Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Taking on the sophisticated single-cutaway style, but including modern-era appointments, the 2017 Les Paul Traditional T is a dream come true for purists who are seeking a no nonsense model that sounds as good as it looks.</p><h3> Classic Les Paul design </h3><p>In keeping with its predecessors, the 2017 Traditional T adheres strictly to the non-weight relieved Les Paul body design, giving it a weighty feel with a resilient sustain. The tonewood partnership here features a two-piece mahogany back, which is paired with an AA grade maple top. The finish has been treated to a slender yet durable layer of smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer to protect against premature wear.</p><h3> Classic rounded neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body via a classic mortis and tenon joint is the single-piece mahogany neck. Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive has been tasked with reinforcing the neck joint to maximise stability and strength. In keeping with the traditional approach, the neck has been shaped to the rounded profile, which gives the neck a more substantial feel in the hand.</p><p>Married to the neck is a sublime 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style.

The headstock is angled to Gibson's customary 17-degrees to improve tuning stability and string tension, whilst the Gibson logo is proudly on display for all to see. The nickel-plated zamak vintage-style keystone tuning machines boast an impressive 14:01 tuning ratio, firmly securing your strings during each and every performance as you rock out.</p><p>The body is home to the aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with titanium saddles and locking thumbwheels, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar with locking studs. The bridge and tailpiece partnership works dutifully to ensure intonation and sustain is optimised so that your Les Paul sings beautifully, and with the richness it deserves.</p><h3>Burstbucker 1 and 2 humbucker pickups</h3><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional T Electric Guitar has been fitted with a Burstbucker 1 and 2 humbuckers, fitted in the neck and bridge positions respectively. The Alnico II-powered Burstbuckers translate the richness of the body tonewoods, and the articulation of the neck and fingerboard construction with impeccable clarity. Control over the pickups comes in the form of classic gold Top Hat knobs, which complement the stunning finish beautifully.Included Accessories</p><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional T Electric Guitar is supplied with its very own Gibson hardshell aluminium case with plush lined interior.

With an array of upgraded appointments, exquisite tonewoods and an incredibly durable construction, the SE Custom 24 will have you hooked.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>In keeping with tradition, the SE Custom 24 features the quintessential double body cutaway profile. Thanks to this open shape, you have complete access to all the frets the neck has to offer. The body top is constructed from maple and also has a maple veneer which adds to its appearance as well as protecting its colour finish. Mahogany is chosen to construct the back which works extremely well with the maple top for a top tonewood partnership.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>The 25 inch scale length SE Custom 24 is fitted with a smooth maple neck. The neck is shaped to a wide thin profile which is particularly suited to fast players and lead guitarists. The neck is then topped with a rosewood fingerboard which is home to 24 frets.

The tone you hear from the guitar is second to none. The updated 85/15 """"S"""" pickups produce sweet highs that chime so beautifully. The low and midrange notes are clear and defined, offering you an extensive range of tones to explore. The 85/15 """"S"""" dual humbuckers are often sought after and it's easy to see why, plus they only appear in core PRS guitars and cannot be sourced otherwise.</p><p>There is a 3-way pickup switch blade which allows you to easily flick between pickup combinations to suit your playing needs. Simple controls for Volume and Tone facilitate sound tweaking whether you're recording or performing live.</p><h3>Hardware and Finish</h3><p>A PRS patented tremolo bridge is firmly fitted at the lower bout of the body and can execute pitch bends excellently. At the headstock, PRS SE tuners ensure that tuning accuracy is upheld with precision. The headstock also features an updated logo with Paul Reed Smith's signature above the """"SE"""". Nickel hardware adds a neat visual aesthetic to the maple veneer finish.</p><p>As with any PRS, the sheer quality of the design and build is outstanding.

Everything about this model screams excellence, and to play one will have you craving the limelight - so it is a good job that each model is supplied with an aluminium travel case and accessory kit.</p><h3>Sublime solidbody</h3><p>The 2018 SG Standard HP raises the bar for SGs in terms of build quality. The body is crafted using mahogany, which establishes a solid midrange tonal foundation. Paired with the body is a visually commanding AA figured maple top, which sets off the spectacular visual aesthetic beautifully. The deep double-cutaway """"horns"""" are present and correct, with sweetly bevelled edges complementing the slimline design to create the unbelievably comfortable playing feel that has drawn so many players to the SG.</p><h3>Fast playing neck</h3><p>Fitted to the body is a meticulously crafted neck, which is shaped to the slimtaper profile that is paired with the soloist neck width for the perfect balance of speed and accuracy. For unrestricted control over string action and better sustain there is a titanium adjustable nut with locking feature. As ever, the SG rewards fearless players and those who like to rock out in style. Married to the neck is a luxurious rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 24 low profile frets that have been cryogenically treated. The fingerboard is adorned with pearl trapezoid position inlays to guide you along its entire length.</p><h3>'57 Classic humbuckers</h3><p>Gibson have employed a pair of classic humbucker pickups in the 2018 SG Standard HP, with a '57 Classic in the neck position and a Super '57 Classic in the bridge position. The '57 Classic humbuckers are designed to accurately replicate the original PAF-style tone heard on the original SG models.</p><p>However, the modern-day twist on the electronics setup makes the Standard HP a highly adaptable model, expanding the tonal versatility of the SG further than before. The volume pots have push-pull switches to coil tap each pickup, whilst the DIP switch enables a range of tones to be plucked from the humbuckers. Whatever style of music you play, this guitar can traverse any musical landscape with ease.</p><h3>Improved G-FORCE tuning system</h3><p>Gibson's G-FORCE auto-tuning system has also been given an upgrade, so that fast, accurate string tuning is now even easier than ever before. Whether you're playing in standard, using an alternate tuning, or making up your own that you can save and recall at a later time, you'll be amazed at how smoothly the G-FORCE system operates.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware</h3><p>The headstock is home to a bell-shaped chrome truss rod cover, whilst the distinctive Gibson logo resides between the tuning machines. The body is home to the chrome finished aluminium Tune-O-Matic bridge with titanium saddles, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar tailpiece.

The low and midrange notes are clear-cut, offering you a universe of tones to explore. The 85/15 """"S"""" dual humbuckers are a coveted pair of pickups, especially as you can only get these when you purchase a core PRS model from the range.</p><p>The controls have a simple setup but have everything you need to tweak Volume and Tone. There is also a 3-way toggle switch to alter between pickup combinations.</p><h3>Hardware and Finish</h3><p>The lower bout of the body is fitted with a PRS-designed tremolo bridge to perform excellent pitch bends. You need not worry about going out of tune as the PRS-designed tuners ensure total tuning accuracy. The headstock also features an updated logo with Paul Reed Smith's signature above the """"SE"""". The nickel hardware adds a neat visual aesthetic to the flame maple veneer finish.</p><p>The PRS 2017 SE Custom 22 is an electric guitar that fuses vintage inspiration in its sound and feel with the classic, meticulous PRS setup, so it's ready to play from the moment you take it out of the box.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,PRS,TRUE,,,,,,,988-988-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/6f81e6462a6675a297d2aae76a1037e8.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"PRS 2017 SE Custom 22 Electric Guitar - Whale Blue","PRS 2017 SE Custom 22 Electric Guitar - Whale Blue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Now the guys at Gibson Custom have brought it back with historically accurate appointments to give you a reincarnation that is as close to the original as possible. This was one of the first Gibson sunburst models which has since become legendary and this new version brings it right up to date.</p><h3>MAPLE AND MAHOGANY</h3><p>In 1958 when Gibson first designed the original Les Paul Standard guitars, they would all feature a two-piece maple body top, and the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard indeed has a two-piece figured maple top. Figured maple is instantly eye-catching due to its flame-like texture while it also contributes to producing that vintage, '58 sound of the original.</p><p>The top is accompanied by mahogany in the back and sides which makes for the perfect partnership with the figured maple top to produce a strong, resonant output as authentic as those models which were first released in the late 50s. This version is given the 1950s style Les Paul body contour with no weight relief for a historically correct feel.</p><h3>VINTAGE CORRECT NECK</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard is fitted with a single-piece mahogany neck with a comfortable 1950's style Les Paul profile. It is firmly joined to the body using hot hide-glue which was a constitutional element of the original guitars. The neck also has a historic long-tenon neck joint which enables the guitar to precisely convey its classic tone.</p><p>Aboard the neck is a solid, one-piece Indian rosewood fingerboard which assists the mahogany in providing an all-round Les Paul sound. With 22 frets at your service, you can work your way up and down the neck in confidence thanks to the cellulose Trapezoid inlays.</p><h3>CUSTOM BUCKER PICKUPS</h3><p>Gibson have employed Custom Bucker pickups in the electronics of the Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard, and consider them to be their best replica of PAF pickups yet. The Custom Buckers achieve an output that is as close to the original sound of a '58 guitar as you can imagine. Each pickup is powered by Alnico III magnets which deliver you a mix of epic ringing or deep rumble depending on the sound output that you require.</p><p>To help you control the rhythm and lead pickups, the guitar is fitted with two Volume and two Tone pots with matched 500k potentiometers and encased with gold top hats.</p><h3>HARDWARE AND FINISH</h3><p>The Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul Standard has an ABR bridge with thumbwheels partnered with a lightweight aluminium stop bar tailpiece which enhances the overall intonation and sustain. At the top end of the guitar at the headstock we have reissue Kluson deluxe green keys made with nickel plated steel to uphold tuning integrity with accuracy.</p><p>Protecting the beautiful, hand-sprayed nitrocellulose finish on the body is a 1950's style cream pickguard which also really complements the guitar. The guitar also comes equipped with a reissue Les Paul case with a brown outer and pink fur lining to further protect this wonderful guitar.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,547-547-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/e1744385258066cf2abde54d415269b5.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul - Washed Cherry","Gibson Standard Historic 1958 Les Paul - Washed Cherry",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Taking on the sophisticated single-cutaway style, but including modern-era appointments, the 2017 Les Paul Traditional T is a dream come true for purists who are seeking a no nonsense model that sounds as good as it looks.</p><h3> Classic Les Paul design </h3><p>In keeping with its predecessors, the 2017 Traditional T adheres strictly to the non-weight relieved Les Paul body design, giving it a weighty feel with a resilient sustain. The tonewood partnership here features a two-piece mahogany back, which is paired with an AA grade maple top. The finish has been treated to a slender yet durable layer of smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer to protect against premature wear.</p><h3> Classic rounded neck </h3><p>Fitted to the body via a classic mortis and tenon joint is the single-piece mahogany neck. Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive has been tasked with reinforcing the neck joint to maximise stability and strength. In keeping with the traditional approach, the neck has been shaped to the rounded profile, which gives the neck a more substantial feel in the hand.</p><p>Married to the neck is a sublime 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, which is adorned with trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. The fingerboard has been increased in thickness, which makes it ideal for those who like to flex their playing muscles. Cream binding traces along the edge of the fingerboard to create seamless transitions between frets.</p><h3> Resilient, stage-ready hardware </h3><p>At the top of the neck you'll find the nylon nut, which continues the nod to the Les Paul's heritage whilst guaranteeing exceptional tone, sustain and durability. The headstock is angled to Gibson's customary 17-degrees to improve tuning stability and string tension, whilst the Gibson logo is proudly on display for all to see. The nickel-plated zamak vintage-style keystone tuning machines boast an impressive 14:01 tuning ratio, firmly securing your strings during each and every performance as you rock out.</p><p>The body is home to the aluminium Tune-o-Matic bridge with titanium saddles and locking thumbwheels, which is paired with an aluminium stop bar with locking studs. The bridge and tailpiece partnership works dutifully to ensure intonation and sustain is optimised so that your Les Paul sings beautifully, and with the richness it deserves.</p><h3>Burstbucker 1 nd 2 humbucker pickups</h3><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional T Electric Guitar has been fitted with a Burstbucker 1 and 2 humbuckers, fitted in the neck and bridge positions respectively. The Alnico II-powered Burstbuckers translate the richness of the body tonewoods, and the articulation of the neck and fingerboard construction with impeccable clarity. Control over the pickups comes in the form of classic gold Top Hat knobs, which complement the stunning finish beautifully.Included Accessories</p><p>The Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional T Electric Guitar is supplied with its very own Gibson hardshell aluminium case with plush lined interior. Additional accessories include the Gibson USA multi-tool, premium strap, and polishing cloth to keep your new pride and joy in pristine working condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,466-466-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/2cc7555111d20041ef6510772042daee.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional T Electric Guitar","Gibson 2017 Les Paul Traditional T Electric Guitar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active

Through a combination of vintage-style and updated technology, Gibson has captured the vibrant energy and character of a classic Les Paul, whilst exceeding the tonal demands of today's guitarists.</p><h3>Sleek Les Paul design</h3><p>As you'd expect, the body is crafted using classic combination of two-piece mahogany that has been combined with a grade A plain maple top. The mahogany has been treated to a 9-hole weight relief rout, which makes the body lighter and easier to wield, without losing any of that raw Les Paul power. The maple doesn't just look pretty either; it lends itself to a sweetly delivered high-end that allows this beauty to truly sparkle. The body protected by a smooth hi-gloss 90 sheen lacquer, which preserves that natural grain and paintwork to allow your Les Paul to age gracefully.</p><h3>Single-piece mahogany neck</h3><p>To create a confident playing feel, Gibson have fitted a single-piece mahogany neck using a solid mortise and tenon joint reinforced using Franklin Titebond 50 adhesive. You can rest assured that no matter how hard you play, the neck is built with durability at its heart. Thanks to its slimtaper profile, the neck is delightfully slender and accommodating most player's hands with ease.</p><p>Married to the neck is a heavenly rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. Cream binding along the fingerboard ensures seamless transitions between frets, whilst the standard 12-inch radius makes it a breeze to perform smooth string bends.</p><h3>Zebra '57 Classic humbuckers</h3><p>To create a tonal match for the sophisticated '60s/'70s aesthetic, the Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic T Left Handed Electric Guitar is equipped with a Zebra '57 Classic in the neck position, and a Zebra '57 Classic Plus in the bridge. The depth and warmth of the mahogany is given the commanding presence it deserves, with a hearty mid to low-end energy flowing from the pickups, thanks to the wound Alnico II magnet-driven humbuckers. The crispness of the maple rings truly, offering a snappy counterpoint to the dense mahogany.</p><p>Control over the pickups comes via the pickup independent volume and tone controls, which allow you to sculpt and shape your tone with precision. Orange Drop capacitors ensure that the slightest of adjustments is executed as smoothly as possible, putting absolute tone control in your hands.</p><h3>Gig-ready hardware </h3><p>The headstock is home to Grover's zamak locking tuners with an impressive 14:01 tuning ratio, so you can rest assured that no slipping will occur during any emphatic string bending.

The generous 34-inch scale length of the neck is paired with a 12-inch fingerboard radius, laying the foundation for an accommodating playing surface for your fingers to explore.</p><h3> EB Rhythm and Lead Humbuckers </h3><p>With a tone wood combo as potent as this, some equally powerful pickups are in order. Two Alnico V magnet-powered humbuckers are equipped, which deliver a high-gain output with fat tone. Each of these has its own volume control, so that tones can be blended from each pickup, whilst a master tone pot allows you to embellish output from low to high frequencies.</p><h3> Stage-ready hardware </h3><p>Fitted to the body is a Babicz full-contact bridge, which creates a seamless connection between the strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain. The headstock is home to Grover tuners which provide stability throughout the most energetic of performances with a durable 20:01 tuning ratio. The newly appointed self-lubricating TekToid nut also works tirelessly to upheld sustain and pitch accuracy.</p><h3> Included Accessories </h3><p>The Gibson 2017 EB Bass 4 String T Bass Guitar is supplied with a Gibson EVF gig bag to protect your pride and joy at home and on the move. Along with the gig bag, each model is supplied with a Gibson USA guitar strap, polishing cloth, truss rod wench, and 2.5mm adjustment wrench to help you keep your EB Bass in pristine condition.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,"Gibson Guitars",TRUE,,,,,,,416-416-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/490f5adc50cbd896b48e6c56a9f56236.jpeg,1,,FALSE,"Gibson 2017 EB Bass 4 String T Bass Guitar - Satin Vintage Sunburst","Gibson 2017 EB Bass 4 String T Bass Guitar - Satin Vintage Sunburst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active
