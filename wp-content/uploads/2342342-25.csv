Throughout their long-standing working relationship, both Ibanez and Vai have benefited from their fruitful collaborations, creating some truly stunning models along the way. With their latest incarnation of the Jem, this is one to be treasured and appreciated. </p> <h3> Body </h3> <p> Adhering to the classic body design - complete with unique """"monkey grip"""" to aid in performing flashy stage manoeuvres -, the sleek and slender Super-Strat body profile has been crafted using lightweight American Basswood. Thanks to the wood's character, it produces a delightfully balanced tonality that enables the full sonic spectrum to be manipulated with the greatest of ease. The """"Blue Floral Pattern"""" finish is mesmerising, with a translucent pickguard enabling to perfect artwork to be exhibited in all its glory. </p> <h3> Neck </h3> <p> Married to the body is a five-piece maple/walnut neck, which is shaped to the peerless Wizard profile. Ibanez know a thing or two about creating necks that are a joy to play, enabling you to tear along at lightning speeds. The neck has been reinforced with KTS Titanium rods so you can rest assured that string action is consistent no matter what. Paired with the neck is a maple fingerboard, which is home to 24-frets that are a guitarist's dream. Adorning the fingerboard is a divine """"Tree of Life"""" inlay, which traces the gorgeous body finish all the way up to the headstock. </p> <h3> Hardware </h3> <p> Fitted to the body is a responsive and easy to control Edge-Zero II locking tremolo bridge, so you can dive and wail to your heart's content, safe in the knowledge that the bridge will return to original position smoothly and swiftly. The chrome black hardware is understated, and complements the finish beautifully. </p> <h3> Electronics </h3> <p> The Jem77P is equipped with trio of DiMarzio pickups: Gravity Storm humbucking pickups in the neck and bridge positions, an Evolution single-coil pickup in the middle position. Between the three pickups you have a universe of tonal exploration ahead of you. Control couldn't be simpler, with a master volume and a master tone pot to shape and sculpt your output, as well as a 5-way pickup selector switch. </p> <p> The Jem has been turning heads since its introduction over 25 years ago, and with the Ibanez Jem77P Steve Vai Signature Guitar with Blue Floral Pattern they've done it again. Visually stunning, sonically brilliant, tonally diverse, and a joy to play. What more could any guitarist desire? Well as a welcome addition, Ibanez has included a hardshell case to protect your pride and joy. </p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Ibanez Guitars,TRUE,1,2,,,,,777-777-0-0,0,shopify,1000,continue,manual,39,0,TRUE,TRUE,,https://img.staticdj.com/0cfd21d789de23367144a6a9f3e51c38.jpeg,1,,FALSE,Ibanez Jem77P Steve Vai Signature Guitar - Blue Floral Pattern,Ibanez Jem77P Steve Vai Signature Guitar - Blue Floral Pattern,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kg,,,active,TRUE,TRUE
