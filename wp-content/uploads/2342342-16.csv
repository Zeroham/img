Limited to just 250 models worldwide, you'll have to move fast if you want to get your hands on one of these exclusive guitars.</p><h3> Classic Les Paul design </h3><p>Slash belting out legendary riffs on his Les Paul is one of the most iconic images in rock. The Gibson Custom Slash Les Paul takes on the customary tonewood single-customary body profile that we've all come to know and love. Lightweight mahogany establishes a firm and resounding midrange tonal foundation, infused with warm and a hearty sustain. Paired with this is a plain maple top, which is finished in a unique green Anaconda Burst paintwork that creates a striking visual aesthetic.</p><h3> Sturdy yet supple neck </h3><p>Connected to the body is a solid mahogany neck, which is fitted using a long tenon joint for improved sustain, and reinforced with a hide glue fit. The profile is shaped to Slash's custom taper, with a .910-inch depth at the 1st fret extending to a 1.05-inch depth at the 12th fret. The custom taper feels fast in the hand, and accommodates speedy solos to be executed with ease.</p><h3> Luxurious fingerboard </h3><p>Paired with the neck is a divine rosewood fingerboard, which is home to 22 frets that are adorned with trapezoid inlays to guide your way in style. The classic Les Paul single-cutaway opens up access to the highest frets, giving you free rein to let your fingers roam freely. Binding guarantees that seamless transition between frets are the norm, removing unwanted obstacles to maximise that lightning fast playing feel.</p><h3> Slash Signature Seymour Duncan pickups </h3><p>It is only fitting that the Gibson Custom Slash Les Paul be equipped with Slash's Signature Seymour Duncan APH-1 and APH-2 pickups. Since the recording of the seminal Guns N' Roses' album """"Appetite for Destruction"""", Slash has favoured the APH-1, with Seymour Duncan creating the APH-2 in its visage. The intensity of Slash's playing style is magnified when these pickups are cranked, but also retain a subtlety when rolled back during more intimate moments. Control over the pickups comes in the form of 500K CTS Volume and Tone pots, with hand-wired harness that feature Sprague Orange Drop capacitors, so that no matter how minor the attenuation, you have the smoothest of control with absolute precision. A Switchcraft toggle switch affords the same level of precision when changing between the bridge and neck pickups.</p><h3> Immaculate hardware </h3><p>The body is home to a nickel-finished lightweight aluminium ABR-1 bridge, which creates a seamless transition between strings and body to optimise intonation and sustain. Every inch of the Gibson Custom Slash Les Paul has been pored over to ensure it is completed to the highest possible standard. A brown/pink Custom Shop case is supplied with every model to guarantee that your pride and joy is well protected for many years to come.</p></div></div></div>",mysite,guitar,Gibson Guitars,TRUE,,,,,,,504-504-0-0,2323,,0,deny,manual,39,,TRUE,TRUE,'875761003269,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0745/5739/1157/products/3d09465ff93c38b900c57f5c0a6626f68d7d88a04303ead3b7189c81feb84fab.jpg?v=1685014980,1,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active,TRUE,TRUE,,,
